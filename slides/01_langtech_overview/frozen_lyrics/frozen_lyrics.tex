\textbf{Frozen Parody}\\

Lit white snow on the mountain tonight\\
No visible legs\\
Discrimination law\\
Is probably the queen.\\

Rotating, the wind is howling storm\\
They cannot do that, God knows I've tried.\\

Do not let them, do not let them see\\
It is always a good girl\\
Hide, do not feel, do not know\\
Well now you know!\\

Give up, give up\\
You cannot do it back in\\
Give up, give up\\
Tune in and slam the door\\

You do not care\\
What you're saying\\
Let us very angry\\
Cold never bothered me!\\

It's funny how certain distance\\
How small is everything\\
And the fear is that once guided me\\
They do not know me at all!\\

Now is the time to do\\
limitations and improvements, challenge\\
Well, ok, I have no power, I am\\

Give up, give up\\
I am the wind and the weather\\
Give up, give up\\
Will never see me cry!\\

For it\\
We will stay here\\
The storm is raging$\ldots$\\

Flurries of my ability, in the air into the ground\\
My large circle fractal freezing\\
Explosive idea is crystalized ice\\
I never will go back\\
The past is the past!\\

Give up, give up\\
On the rise for radiation\\
Give up, give up\\
It runs perfect woman!\\

I'm here\\
The light of day\\
Let us very angry,\\
Cold never bothered me anyway!\\

\textbf{Frozen Original}\\

The snow glows white on the mountain tonight\\
Not a footprint to be seen\\
A kingdom of isolation,\\
And it looks like I'm the queen.\\

The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside\\
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried!\\

Don't let them in, don't let them see\\
Be the good girl you always have to be\\
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know\\
Well, now they know!\\

Let it go, let it go\\
Can't hold it back anymore\\
Let it go, let it go\\
Turn away and slam the door!\\

I don't care\\
What they're going to say\\
Let the storm rage on,\\
The cold never bothered me anyway!\\

It's funny how some distance\\
Makes everything seem small\\
And the fears that once controlled me\\
Can't get to me at all!\\

It's time to see what I can do\\
To test the limits and break through\\
No right, no wrong, no rules for me I'm free!\\

Let it go, let it go\\
I am one with the wind and sky\\
Let it go, let it go\\
You'll never see me cry!\\

Here I stand\\
And here I'll stay\\
Let the storm rage on!\\

My power flurries through the air into the ground\\
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around\\
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast\\
I'm never going back,\\
The past is in the past!\\

Let it go, let it go\\
When I'll rise like the break of dawn\\
Let it go, let it go\\
That perfect girl is gone!\\

Here I stand\\
In the light of day\\
Let the storm rage on,\\
The cold never bothered me anyway!\\
