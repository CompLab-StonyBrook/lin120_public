    "# Your first steps in Python3\n",
    "\n",
    "## The ultimate goal: Thinking like a programmer\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of this class, you will learn the basics of programming in *Python* --- or more specifically, the current version 3.6 of Python.\n",
    "While there are thousands of programming languages out there, the concepts you will learn apply to all them.\n",
    "This includes basic data types (strings, integers, lists), storing and retrieving values with variables, and control flow (if-then, for).\n",
    "But it's not just the grammar of programming, you will also get a better understanding of how to approach a problem as a programmer.\n",
    "You see, programming is not so much about knowing a programming language, it's about thinking in a way that can be translated into programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If that sounds confusing to you, consider this analogy: being a writer entails more than simply being able to write English sentences.\n",
    "You also have to understand how to structure a text and draw in the reader, what to include and what to cut, and even when to break a rule for greater effect.\n",
    "In the same vein, a programmer has to be able to analyze a problem, cut it down into a sequence of subproblems, come up with mechanical solutions for each subproblem, and then stitch it all back together into a program that solves the original problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want to know how often the word `Hamlet` is said by somebody in Shakespeare's little known play *Hamlet*.\n",
    "That sounds straight-forward, and in a non-programming world it is: grab your copy of Hamlet, and start counting.\n",
    "Boring, but simple.\n",
    "With computers, however, there's a whole slew of issues to sort out.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  A computer can't read a book, so how do you use a copy of *Hamlet*?\n",
    "    Sure, there's digital versions available for free online, but how do you feed that into your program?\n",
    "    \n",
    "1.  Once you somehow managed to get Hamlet into your program, what do you do with it?\n",
    "    How do you tell a computer what a word is, and that you want it to find all those words that exactly match the string `Hamlet`?\n",
    "    And how do you ensure that it only looks at lines that are being uttered by some character, rather than the stage instructions?\n",
    "    \n",
    "1.  How do you do the counting?\n",
    "    It's not enough to just say \"Computer, count!\".\n",
    "    Instead you have to do the equivalent of \"Computer, create a variable with the name `hamlet_counter`, and set it to zero.\n",
    "    Whenever you encounter another instance of `Hamlet`, increase the value of `hamlet_counter` by 1.\"\n",
    "    That's already much more explicit then you have to be for a human.\n",
    "    And guess what?\n",
    "    It's not enough, because you forgot the final instruction: \"Computer, once you've looked at all words in *Hamlet*, tell me the value of `hamlet_counter`.\"\n",
    "    Without that, the computer will gladly count and never reveal the result of its counting.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Just as the old clichee says, computers need extremely explicit instructions for everything.\n",
    "Whereas humans constantly infer obvious and implicit information to figure out what you have in mind, computers will happily follow your instructions by the letter.\n",
    "If there's something missing or unclear, too bad, your program doesn't work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays pretty much everybody is aware of this at a general level, but few are able to formulate their thoughts and ideas at a level of explicitness that is suitable for computers.\n",
    "And that is the true challenge of programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bang for the buck\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a *scripting language*, which essentially means a programming language that is easy to learn while still being useful for most projects.\n",
    "Unless you are trying to design your own operating system, model protein folding, or create the next Photoshop, Python will work just fine.\n",
    "Rudimentary knowledge of Python is already enough to write some neat scripts than can make your life easier.\n",
    "Even if something like a \"best programming language\" existed, there would be no point in learning it if were just too cumbersome to use for daily tasks.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Great community\n",
    "\n",
    "There's tons of learning materials for Python, from textbooks to online course and Youtube videos.\n",
    "And as if that wasn't enough, there's blogs, and a great online community.\n",
    "In general, your problem won't be that you can't get any help with Python, but rather that there's so much stuff that it's hard to pick something.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Longevity\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Python has so many users and so many programs have been written in it, it's not going to disappear any time soon.\n",
    "Many programming languages are just a fad and disappear within a decade, but Python has been very popular for over 20 years now and there are no signs that this will change anytime soon.\n",
    "So your Python skills won't be suddenly obsolete within ten years.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Great libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, a *library* is a piece of code that provides all kinds of helper tools to the programmer.\n",
    "This makes it much easier and faster to write programs because you don't have to design everything yourself from scratch.\n",
    "Python has a humongous number of libraries, \n",
    "    \n",
    "Suppose you want to download *Hamlet* as an HTML file from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org).\n",
    "If you want to do it yourself, you would have to have a serious understanding of networking infrastructure and how you can establish a connection with a server at a specific URL, request a file transfer, and then save the incoming data.\n",
    "Instead of wasting days or weeks on figuring this out, you can just import the `urllib.request` library and put the line `urllib.request.urlretrieve(\"http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1524/pg1524.html\", \"hamlet.html\")` in your program.\n",
    "Don't believe me?\n",
    "Try it for yourself!"
