    "There is a function in python called `all()`. `all()` takes a list and returns True if all the elements in the list are the value `True` and `False` if any of the elements in the list are not `True`. Combining `all()` with list comprehensions gives us a really useful way of checking the elements of a list for some condition. For example, given that there exists some function called `divisible_by_2()` that takes a number and returns whether it is divisible by two. If we have a list such as `l = [2,4,6,8,10]` we can see if all the numbers in that list are divisible by 2 using the following statement: `all(divisible_by_2(i) for i in l)`. This will give us `True` because all the elements are in fact divisible by 2. See some more examples below"
