    "# Literature analysis with unigrams: First the drudgery\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have seen a few simple applications that use tokenization, it's time to look at something more realistic.\n",
    "As you probably know from your English homeworks, comparing works of fiction can be a very hard and time-consuming task.\n",
    "It would be much nicer if we could just have the computer do all the work.\n",
    "But what could a computer possibly have to say about literature?\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple idea is that an author's style is represented by which words (s)he uses, and in particular which words (s)he uses most.\n",
    "Words are also known as *unigrams*.\n",
    "This is in contrast to *bigrams*, which consist of two words, *trigrams* (three words), and so on.\n",
    "For instance, the sentence\n",
    "\n",
    "    John likes Mary and Peter\n",
    "    \n",
    "contains the unigrams\n",
    "\n",
    "    John, likes, Mary, and, Peter\n",
    "    \n",
    "the bigrams\n",
    "\n",
    "    John likes, likes Mary, Mary and, and Peter\n",
    "    \n",
    "and the trigrams\n",
    "\n",
    "    John likes Mary, likes Mary and, Mary and Peter\n",
    "    \n",
    "We could also have 4-grams, 5-grams, or 127-grams.\n",
    "Quite generally, a model that is based on words or sequences of words is called an *n-gram model*.\n",
    "So if we want to analyze an author's style in terms of their word usage, we are proposing a unigram model of stylistic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "But does a unigram model actually work?\n",
    "Well, let's put the idea to the test: we will compare three works of fiction comparing this technique:\n",
    "\n",
    "- William Shakespeare's *Hamlet*\n",
    "- Christopher Marlowe's *The Tragical History of Dr. Faustus*\n",
    "- Edgar Rice Burrough's *A Princess of Mars*\n",
    "\n",
    "If we find something interesting, then unigram models might be worthwhile after all.\n",
    "\n",
    "A brief remark on those works: The first two are world-famous Victorian plays, whereas the third is an early 20th century pulp novel that you might know as the basis for Disney's 2012 box office debacle *John Carter*. Although the movie is better than its reputation, it still doesn't do justice to the book, so give it a read if you are in the mood for a fun science fantasy story."

    "\n",
    "1. While `faustus.txt` and `mars.txt` are fairly easy to read, `hamlet.txt` is cluttered with all kinds of weird code like `<p>` and `<br/>`. That's because we downloaded a textfile for `faustus.txt` and `mars.txt`, but an html-file for `hamlet.txt`. The expressions between `<` and `>` are html-markup, which is needed to display a file in a webbrowser.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All files start with information about Project Gutenberg, which we do not want.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All files have information at the end that is not part of the play. In `hamlet.txt` and `mars.txt`, it's just a disclaimer that the play is over, whereas `faustus.txt` is also full of footnotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In `faustus.txt`, the text is often interrupted by strings like `[17]`. Those are references to footnotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For the two plays, slightly different formats are used to indicate who is speaking.\n",
    "    - In `hamlet.txt`, names are fully capitalized and occur between the markup `<p>` and `<br/>`.\n",
    "      Sometimes there is a dot after the name, sometimes there isn't.\n",
    "    - In `faustus.txt`, names are fully capitalized and followed by a dot.\n",
    "      The actual text usually starts on the same line.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. In `faustus.txt`, stage instructions are indicated by indentation.\n",
    "   In `hamlet.txt`, they occur between `<p class=\"scenedesc\">` and `</p>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In `faustus.txt`, all dialog is indented, but less so than the stage instructions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. All three files contain many empty lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Both plays capitalize words at the beginning of a new line.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In `mars.txt`, Chapters are written in upper caps.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are all problematic for us:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We just want to be able to see which words are used in each play, and how often each word is used.\n",
    "- We do not want HTML markup, information about Project Gutenberg, footnotes, or empty lines.\n",
    "- We also do not want to keep track of names if they just indicate who is speaking. That's not part of the play as such.\n",
    "- We should also exclude stage instructions because those do not belong to the literary part of the play either.\n",
    "\n",
