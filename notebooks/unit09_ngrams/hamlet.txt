<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Francisco</span> and
<span class="charname">Barnardo</span>, two sentinels.</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br/>
Who&rsquo;s there?<br/>
</p>

<p>FRANCISCO.<br/>
Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.<br/>
</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br/>
Long live the King!<br/>
</p>

<p>FRANCISCO.<br/>
Barnardo?<br/>
</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br/>
He.<br/>
</p>

<p>FRANCISCO.<br/>
You come most carefully upon your hour.<br/>
</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.<br/>
</p>

<p>FRANCISCO.<br/>
For this relief much thanks. &rsquo;Tis bitter cold,<br/>
And I am sick at heart.<br/>
</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br/>
Have you had quiet guard?<br/>
</p>

<p>FRANCISCO.<br/>
Not a mouse stirring.<br/>
</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br/>
Well, good night.<br/>
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,<br/>
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.<br/>
</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Horatio</span> and
<span class="charname">Marcellus</span>.</p>

<p>FRANCISCO.<br/>
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
Friends to this ground.<br/>
</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br/>
And liegemen to the Dane.<br/>
</p>

<p>FRANCISCO.<br/>
Give you good night.<br/>
</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br/>
O, farewell, honest soldier, who hath reliev&rsquo;d you?<br/>
</p>

<p>FRANCISCO.<br/>
Barnardo has my place. Give you good-night.<br/>
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br/>
Holla, Barnardo!<br/>
</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br/>
Say, what, is Horatio there?<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
A piece of him.<br/>
</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br/>
Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.<br/>
</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br/>
What, has this thing appear&rsquo;d again tonight?<br/>
</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br/>
I have seen nothing.<br/>
</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br/>
Horatio says &rsquo;tis but our fantasy,<br/>
And will not let belief take hold of him<br/>
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.<br/>
Therefore I have entreated him along<br/>
With us to watch the minutes of this night,<br/>
That if again this apparition come<br/>
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
Tush, tush, &rsquo;twill not appear.<br/>
</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br/>
Sit down awhile,<br/>
And let us once again assail your ears,<br/>
That are so fortified against our story,<br/>
What we two nights have seen.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
Well, sit we down,<br/>
And let us hear Barnardo speak of this.<br/>
</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br/>
Last night of all,<br/>
When yond same star that&rsquo;s westward from the pole,<br/>
Had made his course t&rsquo;illume that part of heaven<br/>
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,<br/>
The bell then beating one&mdash;<br/>
</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br/>
Peace, break thee off. Look where it comes again.<br/>
</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Ghost</span>.</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br/>
In the same figure, like the King that&rsquo;s dead.<br/>
</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br/>
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.<br/>
</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br/>
Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.<br/>
</p>

<p>BARNARDO<br/>
It would be spoke to.<br/>
</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br/>
Question it, Horatio.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
What art thou that usurp&rsquo;st this time of night,<br/>
Together with that fair and warlike form<br/>
In which the majesty of buried Denmark<br/>
Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak.<br/>
</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br/>
It is offended.<br/>
</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br/>
See, it stalks away.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee speak!<br/>
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exit <span class="charname">Ghost</span>.</i>]</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis gone, and will not answer.<br/>
</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br/>
How now, Horatio! You tremble and look pale.<br/>
Is not this something more than fantasy?<br/>
What think you on&rsquo;t?<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
Before my God, I might not this believe<br/>
Without the sensible and true avouch<br/>
Of mine own eyes.<br/>
</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br/>
Is it not like the King?<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
As thou art to thyself:<br/>
Such was the very armour he had on<br/>
When he th&rsquo;ambitious Norway combated;<br/>
So frown&rsquo;d he once, when in an angry parle<br/>
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis strange.<br/>
</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br/>
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,<br/>
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
In what particular thought to work I know not;<br/>
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,<br/>
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.<br/>
</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br/>
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,<br/>
Why this same strict and most observant watch<br/>
So nightly toils the subject of the land,<br/>
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon<br/>
And foreign mart for implements of war;<br/>
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task<br/>
Does not divide the Sunday from the week.<br/>
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste<br/>
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:<br/>
Who is&rsquo;t that can inform me?<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
That can I;<br/>
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last King,<br/>
Whose image even but now appear&rsquo;d to us,<br/>
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,<br/>
Thereto prick&rsquo;d on by a most emulate pride,<br/>
Dar&rsquo;d to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet,<br/>
For so this side of our known world esteem&rsquo;d him,<br/>
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal&rsquo;d compact,<br/>
Well ratified by law and heraldry,<br/>
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands<br/>
Which he stood seiz&rsquo;d of, to the conqueror;<br/>
Against the which, a moiety competent<br/>
Was gaged by our King; which had return&rsquo;d<br/>
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,<br/>
Had he been vanquisher; as by the same cov&rsquo;nant<br/>
And carriage of the article design&rsquo;d,<br/>
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,<br/>
Of unimproved mettle, hot and full,<br/>
Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,<br/>
Shark&rsquo;d up a list of lawless resolutes,<br/>
For food and diet, to some enterprise<br/>
That hath a stomach in&rsquo;t; which is no other,<br/>
As it doth well appear unto our state,<br/>
But to recover of us by strong hand<br/>
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands<br/>
So by his father lost. And this, I take it,<br/>
Is the main motive of our preparations,<br/>
The source of this our watch, and the chief head<br/>
Of this post-haste and rummage in the land.<br/>
</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br/>
I think it be no other but e&rsquo;en so:<br/>
Well may it sort that this portentous figure<br/>
Comes armed through our watch so like the King<br/>
That was and is the question of these wars.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
A mote it is to trouble the mind&rsquo;s eye.<br/>
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,<br/>
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,<br/>
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead<br/>
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;<br/>
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,<br/>
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star,<br/>
Upon whose influence Neptune&rsquo;s empire stands,<br/>
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.<br/>
And even the like precurse of fierce events,<br/>
As harbingers preceding still the fates<br/>
And prologue to the omen coming on,<br/>
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated<br/>
Unto our climatures and countrymen.<br/>
</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> Re-enter <span class="charname">Ghost</span>.</p>

<p>But, soft, behold! Lo, where it comes again!<br/>
I&rsquo;ll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!<br/>
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,<br/>
Speak to me.<br/>
If there be any good thing to be done,<br/>
That may to thee do ease, and grace to me,<br/>
Speak to me.<br/>
If thou art privy to thy country&rsquo;s fate,<br/>
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid,<br/>
O speak!<br/>
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life<br/>
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,<br/>
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,<br/>
Speak of it. Stay, and speak!
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>The cock crows.</i>]</p>

<p>Stop it, Marcellus!<br/>
</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br/>
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
Do, if it will not stand.<br/>
</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis here!<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis here!<br/>
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exit <span class="charname">Ghost</span>.</i>]</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis gone!<br/>
We do it wrong, being so majestical,<br/>
To offer it the show of violence,<br/>
For it is as the air, invulnerable,<br/>
And our vain blows malicious mockery.<br/>
</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br/>
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
And then it started, like a guilty thing<br/>
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard<br/>
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,<br/>
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat<br/>
Awake the god of day; and at his warning,<br/>
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,<br/>
Th&rsquo;extravagant and erring spirit hies<br/>
To his confine. And of the truth herein<br/>
This present object made probation.<br/>
</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br/>
It faded on the crowing of the cock.<br/>
Some say that ever &rsquo;gainst that season comes<br/>
Wherein our Saviour&rsquo;s birth is celebrated,<br/>
The bird of dawning singeth all night long;<br/>
And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,<br/>
The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,<br/>
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm;<br/>
So hallow&rsquo;d and so gracious is the time.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
So have I heard, and do in part believe it.<br/>
But look, the morn in russet mantle clad,<br/>
Walks o&rsquo;er the dew of yon high eastward hill.<br/>
Break we our watch up, and by my advice,<br/>
Let us impart what we have seen tonight<br/>
Unto young Hamlet; for upon my life,<br/>
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.<br/>
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,<br/>
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?<br/>
</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br/>
Let&rsquo;s do&rsquo;t, I pray, and I this morning know<br/>
Where we shall find him most conveniently.<br/>

<h4><b>SCENE II. Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.</b></h4>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter Claudius <span class="charname">King</span> of Denmark,
Gertrude the <span class="charname">Queen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, Voltemand,<br/>
Cornelius, Lords</span> and <span class="charname">Attendant</span>.</p>

<p>KING.<br/>
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother&rsquo;s death<br/>
The memory be green, and that it us befitted<br/>
To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom<br/>
To be contracted in one brow of woe;<br/>
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature<br/>
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,<br/>
Together with remembrance of ourselves.<br/>
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,<br/>
Th&rsquo;imperial jointress to this warlike state,<br/>
Have we, as &rsquo;twere with a defeated joy,<br/>
With one auspicious and one dropping eye,<br/>
With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,<br/>
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,<br/>
Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr&rsquo;d<br/>
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone<br/>
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.<br/>
Now follows, that you know young Fortinbras,<br/>
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,<br/>
Or thinking by our late dear brother&rsquo;s death<br/>
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,<br/>
Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,<br/>
He hath not fail&rsquo;d to pester us with message,<br/>
Importing the surrender of those lands<br/>
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,<br/>
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.<br/>
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:<br/>
Thus much the business is: we have here writ<br/>
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,<br/>
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears<br/>
Of this his nephew&rsquo;s purpose, to suppress<br/>
His further gait herein; in that the levies,<br/>
The lists, and full proportions are all made<br/>
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch<br/>
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,<br/>
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,<br/>
Giving to you no further personal power<br/>
To business with the King, more than the scope<br/>
Of these dilated articles allow.<br/>
Farewell; and let your haste commend your duty.<br/>
</p>

<p>CORNELIUS and VOLTEMAND.<br/>
In that, and all things, will we show our duty.<br/>
</p>

<p>KING.<br/>
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.<br/>
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exeunt <span class="charname">Voltemand</span> and
<span class="charname">Cornelius</span>.</i>]</p>

<p>And now, Laertes, what&rsquo;s the news with you?<br/>
You told us of some suit. What is&rsquo;t, Laertes?<br/>
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,<br/>
And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,<br/>
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?<br/>
The head is not more native to the heart,<br/>
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,<br/>
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.<br/>
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?<br/>
</p>

<p>LAERTES.<br/>
Dread my lord,<br/>
Your leave and favour to return to France,<br/>
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark<br/>
To show my duty in your coronation;<br/>
Yet now I must confess, that duty done,<br/>
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France,<br/>
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.<br/>
</p>

<p>KING.<br/>
Have you your father&rsquo;s leave? What says Polonius?<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave<br/>
By laboursome petition; and at last<br/>
Upon his will I seal&rsquo;d my hard consent.<br/>
I do beseech you give him leave to go.<br/>
</p>

<p>KING.<br/>
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,<br/>
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!<br/>
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son&mdash;<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
[<i>Aside.</i>] A little more than kin, and less than kind.<br/>
</p>

<p>KING.<br/>
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Not so, my lord, I am too much i&rsquo; the sun.<br/>
</p>

<p>QUEEN.<br/>
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,<br/>
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.<br/>
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids<br/>
Seek for thy noble father in the dust.<br/>
Thou know&rsquo;st &rsquo;tis common, all that lives must die,<br/>
Passing through nature to eternity.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Ay, madam, it is common.<br/>
</p>

<p>QUEEN.<br/>
If it be,<br/>
Why seems it so particular with thee?<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Seems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not seems.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,<br/>
Nor customary suits of solemn black,<br/>
Nor windy suspiration of forc&rsquo;d breath,<br/>
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,<br/>
Nor the dejected haviour of the visage,<br/>
Together with all forms, moods, shows of grief,<br/>
That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,<br/>
For they are actions that a man might play;<br/>
But I have that within which passeth show;<br/>
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.<br/>
</p>

<p>KING.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,<br/>
To give these mourning duties to your father;<br/>
But you must know, your father lost a father,<br/>
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound<br/>
In filial obligation, for some term<br/>
To do obsequious sorrow. But to persevere<br/>
In obstinate condolement is a course<br/>
Of impious stubbornness. &rsquo;Tis unmanly grief,<br/>
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,<br/>
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,<br/>
An understanding simple and unschool&rsquo;d;<br/>
For what we know must be, and is as common<br/>
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,<br/>
Why should we in our peevish opposition<br/>
Take it to heart? Fie, &rsquo;tis a fault to heaven,<br/>
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,<br/>
To reason most absurd, whose common theme<br/>
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,<br/>
From the first corse till he that died today,<br/>
&lsquo;This must be so.&rsquo; We pray you throw to earth<br/>
This unprevailing woe, and think of us<br/>
As of a father; for let the world take note<br/>
You are the most immediate to our throne,<br/>
And with no less nobility of love<br/>
Than that which dearest father bears his son<br/>
Do I impart toward you. For your intent<br/>
In going back to school in Wittenberg,<br/>
It is most retrograde to our desire:<br/>

Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,<br/>

Why, &rsquo;tis a loving and a fair reply.<br/>
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;<br/>
This gentle and unforc&rsquo;d accord of Hamlet<br/>
Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,<br/>
No jocund health that Denmark drinks today<br/>
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,<br/>

O that this too too solid flesh would melt,<br/>
Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!<br/>
Or that the Everlasting had not fix&rsquo;d<br/>
His canon &rsquo;gainst self-slaughter. O God! O God!<br/>
How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable<br/>
Seem to me all the uses of this world!<br/>
Fie on&rsquo;t! Oh fie! &rsquo;tis an unweeded garden<br/>
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature<br/>
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!<br/>
But two months dead&mdash;nay, not so much, not two:<br/>
So excellent a king; that was to this<br/>
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother,<br/>
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven<br/>
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!<br/>
Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him<br/>
As if increase of appetite had grown<br/>
By what it fed on; and yet, within a month&mdash;<br/>
Let me not think on&rsquo;t&mdash;Frailty, thy name is woman!<br/>
A little month, or ere those shoes were old<br/>
With which she followed my poor father&rsquo;s body<br/>
Like Niobe, all tears.&mdash;Why she, even she&mdash;<br/>
O God! A beast that wants discourse of reason<br/>
Would have mourn&rsquo;d longer,&mdash;married with mine uncle,<br/>
My father&rsquo;s brother; but no more like my father<br/>
Than I to Hercules. Within a month?<br/>
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears<br/>
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,<br/>
She married. O most wicked speed, to post<br/>
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!<br/>
It is not, nor it cannot come to good.<br/>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
Two nights together had these gentlemen,<br/>
Marcellus and Barnardo, on their watch<br/>
In the dead waste and middle of the night,<br/>
Been thus encounter&rsquo;d. A figure like your father,<br/>
Armed at point exactly, cap-√†-pie,<br/>
Appears before them, and with solemn march<br/>
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk&rsquo;d<br/>
By their oppress&rsquo;d and fear-surprised eyes,<br/>
Within his truncheon&rsquo;s length; whilst they, distill&rsquo;d<br/>
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,<br/>
Stand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me<br/>
In dreadful secrecy impart they did,<br/>
And I with them the third night kept the watch,<br/>
Where, as they had deliver&rsquo;d, both in time,<br/>
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,<br/>
The apparition comes. I knew your father;<br/>
These hands are not more like.<br/>

</p>

My lord, upon the platform where we watch.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Did you not speak to it?<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
My lord, I did;<br/>
But answer made it none: yet once methought<br/>
It lifted up it head, and did address<br/>
Itself to motion, like as it would speak.<br/>
But even then the morning cock crew loud,<br/>
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,<br/>
And vanish&rsquo;d from our sight.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis very strange.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
As I do live, my honour&rsquo;d lord, &rsquo;tis true;<br/>
And we did think it writ down in our duty<br/>
To let you know of it.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.<br/>

</p>

Nay, very pale.<br/>

It would have much amaz&rsquo;d you.<br/>
</p>

Very like, very like. Stay&rsquo;d it long?<br/>

While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.<br/>
</p>

<p>MARCELLUS and BARNARDO.<br/>
Longer, longer.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
Not when I saw&rsquo;t.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
His beard was grizzled, no?<br/>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
It was, as I have seen it in his life,<br/>
A sable silver&rsquo;d.<br/>

I&rsquo;ll speak to it, though hell itself should gape<br/>
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,<br/>
If you have hitherto conceal&rsquo;d this sight,<br/>
Let it be tenable in your silence still;<br/>
And whatsoever else shall hap tonight,<br/>
Give it an understanding, but no tongue.<br/>
I will requite your loves. So, fare ye well.<br/>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Laertes</span> and <span class="charname">Ophelia</span>.</p>

<p>LAERTES.<br/>
My necessaries are embark&rsquo;d. Farewell.<br/>
And, sister, as the winds give benefit<br/>
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,<br/>
But let me hear from you.<br/>
</p>

<p>OPHELIA.<br/>
Do you doubt that?<br/>
</p>

<p>LAERTES.<br/>
For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,<br/>
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood;<br/>
A violet in the youth of primy nature,<br/>
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting;<br/>
The perfume and suppliance of a minute;<br/>
No more.<br/>
</p>

<p>OPHELIA.<br/>
No more but so?<br/>
</p>

<p>LAERTES.<br/>
Think it no more.<br/>
For nature crescent does not grow alone<br/>
In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,<br/>
The inward service of the mind and soul<br/>
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,<br/>
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch<br/>
The virtue of his will; but you must fear,<br/>
His greatness weigh&rsquo;d, his will is not his own;<br/>
For he himself is subject to his birth:<br/>
He may not, as unvalu&rsquo;d persons do,<br/>
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends<br/>
The sanctity and health of this whole state;<br/>
And therefore must his choice be circumscrib&rsquo;d<br/>
Unto the voice and yielding of that body<br/>
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,<br/>
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it<br/>
As he in his particular act and place<br/>
May give his saying deed; which is no further<br/>
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.<br/>
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain<br/>
If with too credent ear you list his songs,<br/>
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open<br/>
To his unmaster&rsquo;d importunity.<br/>
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister;<br/>
And keep you in the rear of your affection,<br/>
Out of the shot and danger of desire.<br/>
The chariest maid is prodigal enough<br/>
If she unmask her beauty to the moon.<br/>
Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes:<br/>
The canker galls the infants of the spring<br/>
Too oft before their buttons be disclos&rsquo;d,<br/>
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth<br/>
Contagious blastments are most imminent.<br/>
Be wary then, best safety lies in fear.<br/>
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.<br/>
</p>

<p>OPHELIA.<br/>
I shall th&rsquo;effect of this good lesson keep<br/>
As watchman to my heart. But good my brother,<br/>
Do not as some ungracious pastors do,<br/>
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;<br/>
Whilst like a puff&rsquo;d and reckless libertine<br/>
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,<br/>
And recks not his own rede.<br/>

</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Laying his hand on <span class="charname">Laertes&rsquo;s</span>

<p>And these few precepts in thy memory<br/>
Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,<br/>
Nor any unproportion&rsquo;d thought his act.<br/>
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.<br/>
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,<br/>
Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;<br/>
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment<br/>
Of each new-hatch&rsquo;d, unfledg&rsquo;d comrade. Beware<br/>
Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,<br/>
Bear&rsquo;t that th&rsquo;opposed may beware of thee.<br/>
Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice:<br/>
Take each man&rsquo;s censure, but reserve thy judgment.<br/>
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,<br/>
But not express&rsquo;d in fancy; rich, not gaudy:<br/>
For the apparel oft proclaims the man;<br/>
And they in France of the best rank and station<br/>
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.<br/>
Neither a borrower nor a lender be:<br/>
For loan oft loses both itself and friend;<br/>
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.<br/>
This above all: to thine own self be true;<br/>
And it must follow, as the night the day,<br/>
Thou canst not then be false to any man.<br/>
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee.<br/>

Marry, well bethought:<br/>

Given private time to you; and you yourself<br/>
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.<br/>
If it be so,&mdash;as so &rsquo;tis put on me,<br/>
And that in way of caution,&mdash;I must tell you<br/>
You do not understand yourself so clearly<br/>
As it behoves my daughter and your honour.<br/>
What is between you? Give me up the truth.<br/>
</p>

<p>OPHELIA.<br/>
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders<br/>
Of his affection to me.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
Affection! Pooh! You speak like a green girl,<br/>
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.<br/>
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?<br/>
</p>

<p>OPHELIA.<br/>
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
Marry, I&rsquo;ll teach you; think yourself a baby;<br/>
That you have ta&rsquo;en these tenders for true pay,<br/>
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;<br/>
Or,&mdash;not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,<br/>
Roaming it thus,&mdash;you&rsquo;ll tender me a fool.<br/>
</p>

<p>OPHELIA.<br/>
My lord, he hath importun&rsquo;d me with love<br/>
In honourable fashion.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.<br/>
</p>

<p>OPHELIA.<br/>
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,<br/>
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,<br/>
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul<br/>
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,<br/>
Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,<br/>
Even in their promise, as it is a-making,<br/>
You must not take for fire. From this time<br/>
Be something scanter of your maiden presence;<br/>
Set your entreatments at a higher rate<br/>
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,<br/>
Believe so much in him that he is young;<br/>
And with a larger tether may he walk<br/>
Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,<br/>
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,<br/>
Not of that dye which their investments show,<br/>
But mere implorators of unholy suits,<br/>
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,<br/>
The better to beguile. This is for all.<br/>
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth<br/>
Have you so slander any moment leisure<br/>
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.<br/>
Look to&rsquo;t, I charge you; come your ways.<br/>

Ay marry is&rsquo;t;<br/>
And to my mind, though I am native here,<br/>
And to the manner born, it is a custom<br/>
More honour&rsquo;d in the breach than the observance.<br/>
This heavy-headed revel east and west<br/>
Makes us traduc&rsquo;d and tax&rsquo;d of other nations:<br/>
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase<br/>
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes<br/>
From our achievements, though perform&rsquo;d at height,<br/>
The pith and marrow of our attribute.<br/>
So oft it chances in particular men<br/>
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,<br/>
As in their birth, wherein they are not guilty,<br/>
Since nature cannot choose his origin,<br/>
By their o&rsquo;ergrowth of some complexion,<br/>
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason;<br/>
Or by some habit, that too much o&rsquo;erleavens<br/>
The form of plausive manners;&mdash;that these men,<br/>
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,<br/>
Being Nature&rsquo;s livery or Fortune&rsquo;s star,&mdash;<br/>
His virtues else,&mdash;be they as pure as grace,<br/>

Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak, I&rsquo;ll go no further.<br/>

<p>GHOST.<br/>
Mark me.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
I will.<br/>
</p>

<p>GHOST.<br/>
My hour is almost come,<br/>
When I to sulph&rsquo;rous and tormenting flames<br/>
Must render up myself.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Alas, poor ghost!<br/>
</p>

<p>GHOST.<br/>
Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing<br/>
To what I shall unfold.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Speak, I am bound to hear.<br/>
</p>

<p>GHOST.<br/>
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
What?<br/>
</p>

<p>GHOST.<br/>
I am thy father&rsquo;s spirit,<br/>
Doom&rsquo;d for a certain term to walk the night,<br/>
And for the day confin&rsquo;d to fast in fires,<br/>
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature<br/>
Are burnt and purg&rsquo;d away. But that I am forbid<br/>
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,<br/>
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word<br/>
Would harrow up thy soul; freeze thy young blood,<br/>
Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres,<br/>
Thy knotted and combined locks to part,<br/>
And each particular hair to stand on end<br/>
Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.<br/>
But this eternal blazon must not be<br/>
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!<br/>
If thou didst ever thy dear father love&mdash;<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
O God!<br/>
</p>

<p>GHOST.<br/>
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Murder!<br/>
</p>

<p>GHOST.<br/>
Murder most foul, as in the best it is;<br/>
But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Haste me to know&rsquo;t, that I, with wings as swift<br/>
As meditation or the thoughts of love<br/>
May sweep to my revenge.<br/>
</p>

<p>GHOST.<br/>
I find thee apt;<br/>
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed<br/>
That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,<br/>
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,<br/>
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark<br/>
Is by a forged process of my death<br/>
Rankly abus&rsquo;d; but know, thou noble youth,<br/>
The serpent that did sting thy father&rsquo;s life<br/>
Now wears his crown.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
O my prophetic soul!<br/>
Mine uncle!<br/>
</p>

<p>GHOST.<br/>
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,<br/>
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,&mdash;<br/>
O wicked wit, and gifts, that have the power<br/>
So to seduce!&mdash;won to his shameful lust<br/>
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.<br/>
O Hamlet, what a falling off was there,<br/>
From me, whose love was of that dignity<br/>
That it went hand in hand even with the vow<br/>
I made to her in marriage; and to decline<br/>
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor<br/>
To those of mine. But virtue, as it never will be mov&rsquo;d,<br/>
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven;<br/>
So lust, though to a radiant angel link&rsquo;d,<br/>
Will sate itself in a celestial bed<br/>
And prey on garbage.<br/>
But soft! methinks I scent the morning air;<br/>
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,<br/>
My custom always of the afternoon,<br/>
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole<br/>
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,<br/>
And in the porches of my ears did pour<br/>
The leperous distilment, whose effect<br/>
Holds such an enmity with blood of man<br/>
That swift as quicksilver it courses through<br/>
The natural gates and alleys of the body;<br/>
And with a sudden vigour it doth posset<br/>
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,<br/>
The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;<br/>
And a most instant tetter bark&rsquo;d about,<br/>
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust<br/>
All my smooth body.<br/>
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother&rsquo;s hand,<br/>
Of life, of crown, of queen at once dispatch&rsquo;d:<br/>
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,<br/>
Unhous&rsquo;led, disappointed, unanel&rsquo;d;<br/>
No reckoning made, but sent to my account<br/>
With all my imperfections on my head.<br/>
O horrible! O horrible! most horrible!<br/>
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;<br/>
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be<br/>
A couch for luxury and damned incest.<br/>
But howsoever thou pursu&rsquo;st this act,<br/>
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive<br/>
Against thy mother aught; leave her to heaven,<br/>
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,<br/>
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!<br/>
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,<br/>
And &rsquo;gins to pale his uneffectual fire.<br/>
Adieu, adieu, adieu. Hamlet, remember me.<br/>
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?<br/>
And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, my heart;<br/>
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,<br/>
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?<br/>
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat<br/>
In this distracted globe. Remember thee?<br/>
Yea, from the table of my memory<br/>
I&rsquo;ll wipe away all trivial fond records,<br/>
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,<br/>
That youth and observation copied there;<br/>
And thy commandment all alone shall live<br/>
Within the book and volume of my brain,<br/>
Unmix&rsquo;d with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!<br/>
O most pernicious woman!<br/>
O villain, villain, smiling damned villain!<br/>
My tables. Meet it is I set it down,<br/>
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain!<br/>
At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.<br/>

Why, right; you are i&rsquo; the right;<br/>
And so, without more circumstance at all,<br/>

You, as your business and desires shall point you,&mdash;<br/>
For every man hath business and desire,<br/>
Such as it is;&mdash;and for my own poor part,<br/>

Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,<br/>
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,<br/>
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.<br/>
For your desire to know what is between us,<br/>
O&rsquo;ermaster&rsquo;t as you may. And now, good friends,<br/>
As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,<br/>
Give me one poor request.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
What is&rsquo;t, my lord? We will.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Never make known what you have seen tonight.<br/>

</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange.<br/>

And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.<br/>
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,<br/>
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come,<br/>
Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,<br/>
How strange or odd soe&rsquo;er I bear myself,&mdash;<br/>
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet<br/>
To put an antic disposition on&mdash;<br/>
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,<br/>
With arms encumber&rsquo;d thus, or this head-shake,<br/>
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,<br/>
As &lsquo;Well, we know&rsquo;, or &lsquo;We could and if we would&rsquo;,<br/>
Or &lsquo;If we list to speak&rsquo;; or &lsquo;There be and if they might&rsquo;,<br/>

With all my love I do commend me to you;<br/>
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is<br/>
May do t&rsquo;express his love and friending to you,<br/>
God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together,<br/>
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.<br/>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.<br/>

<p>REYNALDO.<br/>
I will, my lord.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,<br/>
Before you visit him, to make inquiry<br/>
Of his behaviour.<br/>
</p>

<p>REYNALDO.<br/>
My lord, I did intend it.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,<br/>
Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;<br/>
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,<br/>
What company, at what expense; and finding<br/>
By this encompassment and drift of question,<br/>
That they do know my son, come you more nearer<br/>
Than your particular demands will touch it.<br/>
Take you as &rsquo;twere some distant knowledge of him,<br/>
As thus, &lsquo;I know his father and his friends,<br/>
And in part him&rsquo;&mdash;do you mark this, Reynaldo?<br/>
</p>

<p>REYNALDO.<br/>
Ay, very well, my lord.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
&lsquo;And in part him, but,&rsquo; you may say, &lsquo;not well;<br/>
But if&rsquo;t be he I mean, he&rsquo;s very wild;<br/>
Addicted so and so;&rsquo; and there put on him<br/>
What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank<br/>
As may dishonour him; take heed of that;<br/>
But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips<br/>
As are companions noted and most known<br/>
To youth and liberty.<br/>
</p>

<p>REYNALDO.<br/>
As gaming, my lord?<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing,<br/>
Quarrelling, drabbing. You may go so far.<br/>
</p>

<p>REYNALDO.<br/>
My lord, that would dishonour him.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
Faith no, as you may season it in the charge.<br/>
You must not put another scandal on him,<br/>
That he is open to incontinency;<br/>
That&rsquo;s not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly<br/>
That they may seem the taints of liberty;<br/>
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,<br/>
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,<br/>
Of general assault.<br/>
</p>

<p>REYNALDO.<br/>
But my good lord&mdash;<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
Wherefore should you do this?<br/>
</p>

<p>REYNALDO.<br/>
Ay, my lord, I would know that.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
Marry, sir, here&rsquo;s my drift,<br/>
And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.<br/>
You laying these slight sullies on my son,<br/>
As &rsquo;twere a thing a little soil&rsquo;d i&rsquo; th&rsquo; working,<br/>
Mark you,<br/>
Your party in converse, him you would sound,<br/>
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes<br/>
The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur&rsquo;d<br/>
He closes with you in this consequence;<br/>
&lsquo;Good sir,&rsquo; or so; or &lsquo;friend,&rsquo; or &lsquo;gentleman&rsquo;&mdash;<br/>
According to the phrase or the addition<br/>
Of man and country.<br/>
</p>

<p>REYNALDO.<br/>
Very good, my lord.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
And then, sir, does he this,&mdash;<br/>
He does&mdash;What was I about to say?<br/>
By the mass, I was about to say something. Where did I leave?<br/>
</p>

<p>REYNALDO.<br/>
At &lsquo;closes in the consequence.&rsquo;<br/>
At &lsquo;friend or so,&rsquo; and &lsquo;gentleman.&rsquo;</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
At &lsquo;closes in the consequence&rsquo; ay, marry!<br/>
He closes with you thus: &lsquo;I know the gentleman,<br/>
I saw him yesterday, or t&rsquo;other day,<br/>
Or then, or then, with such and such; and, as you say,<br/>
There was he gaming, there o&rsquo;ertook in&rsquo;s rouse,<br/>
There falling out at tennis&rsquo;: or perchance,<br/>
&lsquo;I saw him enter such a house of sale&rsquo;&mdash;<br/>
<i>Videlicet</i>, a brothel, or so forth. See you now;<br/>
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;<br/>
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,<br/>
With windlasses, and with assays of bias,<br/>
By indirections find directions out.<br/>
So by my former lecture and advice<br/>
Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?<br/>
</p>

<p>REYNALDO.<br/>
My lord, I have.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
God b&rsquo; wi&rsquo; you, fare you well.<br/>
</p>

<p>REYNALDO.<br/>
Good my lord.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
Observe his inclination in yourself.<br/>
</p>

<p>REYNALDO.<br/>
I shall, my lord.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
And let him ply his music.<br/>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>

</p>

<p>OPHELIA.<br/>
My lord, as I was sewing in my chamber,<br/>
Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac&rsquo;d,<br/>
No hat upon his head, his stockings foul&rsquo;d,<br/>
Ungart&rsquo;red, and down-gyved to his ankle,<br/>
Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,<br/>
And with a look so piteous in purport<br/>
As if he had been loosed out of hell<br/>
To speak of horrors, he comes before me.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
Mad for thy love?<br/>
</p>

<p>OPHELIA.<br/>
My lord, I do not know, but truly I do fear it.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
What said he?<br/>
</p>

<p>OPHELIA.<br/>
He took me by the wrist and held me hard;<br/>
Then goes he to the length of all his arm;<br/>
And with his other hand thus o&rsquo;er his brow,<br/>
He falls to such perusal of my face<br/>
As he would draw it. Long stay&rsquo;d he so,<br/>
At last,&mdash;a little shaking of mine arm,<br/>
And thrice his head thus waving up and down,<br/>
He rais&rsquo;d a sigh so piteous and profound<br/>
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk<br/>
And end his being. That done, he lets me go,<br/>
And with his head over his shoulder turn&rsquo;d<br/>
He seem&rsquo;d to find his way without his eyes,<br/>
For out o&rsquo; doors he went without their help,<br/>
And to the last bended their light on me.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.<br/>
This is the very ecstasy of love,<br/>
Whose violent property fordoes itself,<br/>
And leads the will to desperate undertakings,<br/>
As oft as any passion under heaven<br/>
That does afflict our natures. I am sorry,&mdash;<br/>
What, have you given him any hard words of late?<br/>
</p>

<p>OPHELIA.<br/>
No, my good lord; but as you did command,<br/>
I did repel his letters and denied<br/>
His access to me.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
That hath made him mad.<br/>
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment<br/>
I had not quoted him. I fear&rsquo;d he did but trifle,<br/>
And meant to wreck thee. But beshrew my jealousy!<br/>
It seems it is as proper to our age<br/>
To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions<br/>
As it is common for the younger sort<br/>
To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.<br/>
This must be known, which, being kept close, might move<br/>
More grief to hide than hate to utter love.<br/>

<p>KING.<br/>
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.<br/>
Moreover that we much did long to see you,<br/>
The need we have to use you did provoke<br/>
Our hasty sending. Something have you heard<br/>
Of Hamlet&rsquo;s transformation; so I call it,<br/>
Since nor th&rsquo;exterior nor the inward man<br/>
Resembles that it was. What it should be,<br/>
More than his father&rsquo;s death, that thus hath put him<br/>
So much from th&rsquo;understanding of himself,<br/>
I cannot dream of. I entreat you both<br/>
That, being of so young days brought up with him,<br/>
And since so neighbour&rsquo;d to his youth and humour,<br/>
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court<br/>
Some little time, so by your companies<br/>
To draw him on to pleasures and to gather,<br/>
So much as from occasion you may glean,<br/>
Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus<br/>
That, open&rsquo;d, lies within our remedy.<br/>

Good gentlemen, he hath much talk&rsquo;d of you,<br/>

To show us so much gentry and good will<br/>

<p>Welcome, my good friends!<br/>
Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?<br/>
</p>

<p>VOLTEMAND.<br/>
Most fair return of greetings and desires.<br/>
Upon our first, he sent out to suppress<br/>
His nephew&rsquo;s levies, which to him appear&rsquo;d<br/>
To be a preparation &rsquo;gainst the Polack;<br/>
But better look&rsquo;d into, he truly found<br/>
It was against your Highness; whereat griev&rsquo;d,<br/>
That so his sickness, age, and impotence<br/>
Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests<br/>
On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,<br/>
Receives rebuke from Norway; and in fine,<br/>
Makes vow before his uncle never more<br/>
To give th&rsquo;assay of arms against your Majesty.<br/>
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,<br/>
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,<br/>
And his commission to employ those soldiers<br/>
So levied as before, against the Polack:<br/>
With an entreaty, herein further shown,<br/>
[<i>Gives a paper.</i>]<br/>
That it might please you to give quiet pass<br/>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
This business is well ended.<br/>
My liege and madam, to expostulate<br/>
What majesty should be, what duty is,<br/>
Why day is day, night night, and time is time.<br/>
Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.<br/>
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,<br/>
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,<br/>
I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.<br/>
Mad call I it; for to define true madness,<br/>
What is&rsquo;t but to be nothing else but mad?<br/>
But let that go.<br/>
</p>

<p>QUEEN.<br/>
More matter, with less art.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
Madam, I swear I use no art at all.<br/>
That he is mad, &rsquo;tis true: &rsquo;tis true &rsquo;tis pity;<br/>
And pity &rsquo;tis &rsquo;tis true. A foolish figure,<br/>
But farewell it, for I will use no art.<br/>
Mad let us grant him then. And now remains<br/>
That we find out the cause of this effect,<br/>
Or rather say, the cause of this defect,<br/>
For this effect defective comes by cause.<br/>
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend,<br/>

But how hath she receiv&rsquo;d his love?<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
What do you think of me?<br/>
</p>

<p>KING.<br/>
As of a man faithful and honourable.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
I would fain prove so. But what might you think,<br/>
When I had seen this hot love on the wing,<br/>
As I perceiv&rsquo;d it, I must tell you that,<br/>
Before my daughter told me, what might you,<br/>
Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,<br/>
If I had play&rsquo;d the desk or table-book,<br/>
Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,<br/>
Or look&rsquo;d upon this love with idle sight,<br/>
What might you think? No, I went round to work,<br/>
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:<br/>
&lsquo;Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.<br/>
This must not be.&rsquo; And then I precepts gave her,<br/>
That she should lock herself from his resort,<br/>
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.<br/>
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,<br/>
And he, repulsed,&mdash;a short tale to make&mdash;<br/>
Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,<br/>
Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,<br/>
Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,<br/>
Into the madness wherein now he raves,<br/>
And all we wail for.<br/>
</p>

<p>KING.<br/>
Do you think &rsquo;tis this?<br/>
</p>

<p>QUEEN.<br/>
It may be, very likely.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
Hath there been such a time, I&rsquo;d fain know that,<br/>
That I have positively said &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis so,&rsquo;<br/>
When it prov&rsquo;d otherwise?<br/>
</p>

<p>KING.<br/>
Not that I know.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
Take this from this, if this be otherwise.<br/>

Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed<br/>
Within the centre.<br/>

You know sometimes he walks four hours together<br/>
Here in the lobby.<br/>
</p>

So he does indeed.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
At such a time I&rsquo;ll loose my daughter to him.<br/>
Be you and I behind an arras then,<br/>
Mark the encounter. If he love her not,<br/>
And be not from his reason fall&rsquo;n thereon,<br/>
Let me be no assistant for a state,<br/>

<p>How does my good Lord Hamlet?</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Well, God-a-mercy.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
Do you know me, my lord?<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Excellent well. You&rsquo;re a fishmonger.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
Not I, my lord.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Then I would you were so honest a man.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
Honest, my lord?<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Ay sir, to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
picked out of ten thousand.</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
That&rsquo;s very true, my lord.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a good kissing
carrion,&mdash;<br/>
Have you a daughter?</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
I have, my lord.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Let her not walk i&rsquo; th&rsquo; sun. Conception is a blessing, but not
as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
How say you by that? [<i>Aside.</i>] Still harping on my daughter. Yet
he knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger. He is far
gone, far gone. And truly in my youth I suffered much extremity
for love; very near this. I&rsquo;ll speak to him again.&mdash;What do you
read, my lord?</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Words, words, words.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
What is the matter, my lord?<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Between who?<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
I mean the matter that you read, my lord.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Slanders, sir. For the satirical slave says here that old men
have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All which,
sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it
not honesty to have it thus set down. For you yourself, sir,
should be old as I am, if like a crab you could go backward.</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
[<i>Aside.</i>] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in&rsquo;t.&mdash;<br/>
Will you walk out of the air, my lord?<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Into my grave?<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
Indeed, that is out o&rsquo; the air. [<i>Aside.</i>] How pregnant sometimes
his replies are! A happiness that often madness hits on, which
reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I
will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between
him and my daughter.<br/>
My honourable lord, I will most humbly take
my leave of you.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
willingly part withal, except my life, except my life, except my
life.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
Rosencrantz. Good lads, how do ye both?
</p>

<p>ROSENCRANTZ.<br/>
As the indifferent children of the earth.<br/>
</p>

<p>GUILDENSTERN.<br/>
Happy in that we are not over-happy;<br/>
On Fortune&rsquo;s cap we are not the very button.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Nor the soles of her shoe?<br/>
</p>

<p>ROSENCRANTZ.<br/>
Neither, my lord.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
favours?</p>

<p>GUILDENSTERN.<br/>
Faith, her privates we.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
In the secret parts of Fortune? O, most true; she is a
strumpet. What&rsquo;s the news?</p>

<p>ROSENCRANTZ.<br/>
None, my lord, but that the world&rsquo;s grown honest.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Then is doomsday near. But your news is not true. Let me
question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,
deserved at the hands of Fortune, that she sends you to prison
hither?</p>

<p>GUILDENSTERN.<br/>
Prison, my lord?<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Denmark&rsquo;s a prison.<br/>
</p>

<p>ROSENCRANTZ.<br/>
Then is the world one.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
dungeons, Denmark being one o&rsquo; th&rsquo; worst.</p>

<p>ROSENCRANTZ.<br/>
We think not so, my lord.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Why, then &rsquo;tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.</p>

<p>ROSENCRANTZ.<br/>
Why, then your ambition makes it one; &rsquo;tis too narrow for your
mind.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a
king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.</p>

<p>GUILDENSTERN.<br/>
Which dreams, indeed, are ambition; for the very substance of
the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
A dream itself is but a shadow.<br/>
</p>

<p>ROSENCRANTZ.<br/>
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
it is but a shadow&rsquo;s shadow.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch&rsquo;d
heroes the beggars&rsquo; shadows. Shall we to th&rsquo; court? For, by my
fay, I cannot reason.</p>

<p>ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN.<br/>
We&rsquo;ll wait upon you.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
No such matter. I will not sort you with the rest of my
servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
dreadfully attended. But, in the beaten way of friendship, what
make you at Elsinore?</p>

<p>ROSENCRANTZ.<br/>
To visit you, my lord, no other occasion.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you.
And sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were
you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come; nay, speak.</p>

<p>GUILDENSTERN.<br/>
What should we say, my lord?<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Why, anything. But to the purpose. You were sent for; and
there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties
have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and Queen
have sent for you.</p>

<p>ROSENCRANTZ.<br/>
To what end, my lord?<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights
of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a
better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with
me, whether you were sent for or no.</p>

<p>ROSENCRANTZ.<br/>
[<i>To Guildenstern.</i>] What say you?<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
[<i>Aside.</i>] Nay, then I have an eye of you. If you love me, hold
not off.</p>

<p>GUILDENSTERN.<br/>
My lord, we were sent for.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your
discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
feather. I have of late, but wherefore I know not, lost all my
mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so
heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth,
seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy the
air, look you, this brave o&rsquo;erhanging firmament, this majestical
roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing
to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a
piece of work is man! How noble in reason? How infinite in
faculties, in form and moving, how express and admirable? In
action how like an angel? In apprehension, how like a god? The
beauty of the world, the paragon of animals. And yet, to me, what
is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me; no, nor woman
neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.</p>

<p>ROSENCRANTZ.<br/>
My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Why did you laugh then, when I said &lsquo;Man delights not me&rsquo;?<br/>
</p>

<p>ROSENCRANTZ.<br/>
To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what Lenten
entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them
on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
He that plays the king shall be welcome,&mdash;his Majesty shall
have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
target; the lover shall not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall
end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
lungs are tickle a&rsquo; th&rsquo; sere; and the lady shall say her mind
freely, or the blank verse shall halt for&rsquo;t. What players are
they?</p>

<p>ROSENCRANTZ.<br/>
Even those you were wont to take such delight in&mdash;the
tragedians of the city.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
reputation and profit, was better both ways.</p>

<p>ROSENCRANTZ.<br/>
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
innovation.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
city? Are they so followed?</p>

<p>ROSENCRANTZ.<br/>
No, indeed, they are not.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
How comes it? Do they grow rusty?<br/>
</p>

<p>ROSENCRANTZ.<br/>
Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is,
sir, an ayry of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top
of question, and are most tyrannically clapped for&rsquo;t. These are
now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages&mdash;so they call
them&mdash;that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and
dare scarce come thither.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
What, are they children? Who maintains &rsquo;em? How are they
escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
themselves to common players&mdash;as it is most like, if their means
are no better&mdash;their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim
against their own succession?</p>

<p>ROSENCRANTZ.<br/>
Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation
holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was for
a while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player
went to cuffs in the question.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Is&rsquo;t possible?<br/>
</p>

<p>GUILDENSTERN.<br/>
O, there has been much throwing about of brains.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Do the boys carry it away?<br/>
</p>

<p>ROSENCRANTZ.<br/>
Ay, that they do, my lord. Hercules and his load too.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and
those that would make mouths at him while my father lived, give
twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in
little. &rsquo;Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if
philosophy could find it out.</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Flourish of trumpets within.</i>]</p>

<p>GUILDENSTERN.<br/>
There are the players.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come. The
appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply
with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players, which I
tell you must show fairly outward, should more appear like
entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my uncle-father
and aunt-mother are deceived.</p>

<p>GUILDENSTERN.<br/>
In what, my dear lord?<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly, I

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
Well be with you, gentlemen.<br/>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too, at each ear a hearer. That
great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts.</p>

<p>ROSENCRANTZ.<br/>
Happily he&rsquo;s the second time come to them; for they say an old
man is twice a child.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.&mdash;You
say right, sir: for a Monday morning &rsquo;twas so indeed.</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
My lord, I have news to tell you.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome&mdash;<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
The actors are come hither, my lord.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Buzz, buzz.<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
Upon my honour.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Then came each actor on his ass&mdash;<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene
individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
Plautus too light, for the law of writ and the liberty. These are
the only men.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!<br/>
</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
What treasure had he, my lord?<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Why&mdash;<br/>
¬†¬†¬†&rsquo;One fair daughter, and no more,<br/>
¬†¬†¬†The which he loved passing well.&rsquo;<br/>

<p>You are welcome, masters, welcome all. I am glad to see thee
well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old friend! Thy face is
valanc&rsquo;d since I saw thee last. Com&rsquo;st thou to beard me in
Denmark? What, my young lady and mistress! By&rsquo;r lady, your
ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the
altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of
uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring. Masters, you are
all welcome. We&rsquo;ll e&rsquo;en to&rsquo;t like French falconers, fly at
anything we see. We&rsquo;ll have a speech straight. Come, give us a
taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.</p>

<p>FIRST PLAYER.<br/>
What speech, my lord?<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted,
or if it was, not above once, for the play, I remember, pleased
not the million, &rsquo;twas caviare to the general. But it was&mdash;as I
received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in
the top of mine&mdash;an excellent play, well digested in the scenes,
set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury,
nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of
affectation, but called it an honest method, as wholesome as
sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it,
I chiefly loved. &rsquo;Twas Aeneas&rsquo; tale to Dido, and thereabout of it
especially where he speaks of Priam&rsquo;s slaughter. If it live in
your memory, begin at this line, let me see, let me see:<br/>
¬†¬†¬†<i>The rugged Pyrrhus, like th&rsquo; Hyrcanian beast,&mdash;</i><br/>
It is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus&mdash;<br/>
¬†¬†¬†<i>The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,<br/>
¬†¬†¬†Black as his purpose, did the night resemble<br/>
¬†¬†¬†When he lay couched in the ominous horse,<br/>
¬†¬†¬†Hath now this dread and black complexion smear&rsquo;d<br/>
¬†¬†¬†With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot<br/>
¬†¬†¬†Now is he total gules, horridly trick&rsquo;d<br/>
¬†¬†¬†With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,<br/>
¬†¬†¬†Bak&rsquo;d and impasted with the parching streets,<br/>
¬†¬†¬†That lend a tyrannous and a damned light<br/>
¬†¬†¬†To their vile murders. Roasted in wrath and fire,<br/>
¬†¬†¬†And thus o&rsquo;ersized with coagulate gore,<br/>
¬†¬†¬†With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus<br/>
¬†¬†¬†Old grandsire Priam seeks.</i><br/>
So, proceed you.</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
&rsquo;Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
discretion.</p>

<p>FIRST PLAYER.<br/>
¬†¬†¬†<i>Anon he finds him,<br/>
¬†¬†¬†Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,<br/>
¬†¬†¬†Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,<br/>
¬†¬†¬†Repugnant to command. Unequal match&rsquo;d,<br/>
¬†¬†¬†Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;<br/>
¬†¬†¬†But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword<br/>
¬†¬†¬†Th&rsquo;unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,<br/>
¬†¬†¬†Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top<br/>
¬†¬†¬†Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash<br/>
¬†¬†¬†Takes prisoner Pyrrhus&rsquo; ear. For lo, his sword,<br/>
¬†¬†¬†Which was declining on the milky head<br/>
¬†¬†¬†Of reverend Priam, seem&rsquo;d i&rsquo; th&rsquo;air to stick.<br/>
¬†¬†¬†So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,<br/>
¬†¬†¬†And like a neutral to his will and matter,<br/>
¬†¬†¬†Did nothing.<br/>
¬†¬†¬†But as we often see against some storm,<br/>
¬†¬†¬†A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,<br/>
¬†¬†¬†The bold winds speechless, and the orb below<br/>
¬†¬†¬†As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder<br/>
¬†¬†¬†Doth rend the region; so after Pyrrhus&rsquo; pause,<br/>
¬†¬†¬†Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work,<br/>
¬†¬†¬†And never did the Cyclops&rsquo; hammers fall<br/>
¬†¬†¬†On Mars&rsquo;s armour, forg&rsquo;d for proof eterne,<br/>
¬†¬†¬†With less remorse than Pyrrhus&rsquo; bleeding sword<br/>
¬†¬†¬†Now falls on Priam.<br/>
¬†¬†¬†Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,<br/>
¬†¬†¬†In general synod, take away her power;<br/>
¬†¬†¬†Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,<br/>
¬†¬†¬†And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,<br/>
¬†¬†¬†As low as to the fiends.</i><br/>

¬†¬†¬†Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep&rsquo;d,<br/>

¬†¬†¬†When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport<br/>

¬†¬†¬†The instant burst of clamour that she made,&mdash;<br/>
¬†¬†¬†Unless things mortal move them not at all,&mdash;<br/>

Look, where he has not turn&rsquo;d his colour, and has tears in&rsquo;s
eyes. Pray you, no more.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis well. I&rsquo;ll have thee speak out the rest of this
soon.&mdash;Good my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you
hear, let them be well used; for they are the abstracts and brief
chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have a
bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.</p>

<p>POLONIUS.<br/>
My lord, I will use them according to their desert.<br/>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Ay, so, God b&rsquo; wi&rsquo; ye. Now I am alone.<br/>
O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!<br/>
Is it not monstrous that this player here,<br/>
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,<br/>
Could force his soul so to his own conceit<br/>
That from her working all his visage wan&rsquo;d;<br/>
Tears in his eyes, distraction in&rsquo;s aspect,<br/>
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting<br/>
With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!<br/>
For Hecuba?<br/>
What&rsquo;s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,<br/>
That he should weep for her? What would he do,<br/>
Had he the motive and the cue for passion<br/>
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears<br/>
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;<br/>
Make mad the guilty, and appal the free,<br/>
Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed,<br/>
The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,<br/>
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak<br/>
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,<br/>
And can say nothing. No, not for a king<br/>
Upon whose property and most dear life<br/>
A damn&rsquo;d defeat was made. Am I a coward?<br/>
Who calls me villain, breaks my pate across?<br/>
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?<br/>
Tweaks me by the nose, gives me the lie i&rsquo; th&rsquo; throat<br/>
As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this?<br/>
Ha! &rsquo;Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be<br/>
But I am pigeon-liver&rsquo;d, and lack gall<br/>
To make oppression bitter, or ere this<br/>
I should have fatted all the region kites<br/>
With this slave&rsquo;s offal. Bloody, bawdy villain!<br/>
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!<br/>
Oh vengeance!<br/>
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,<br/>
That I, the son of a dear father murder&rsquo;d,<br/>
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,<br/>
Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words<br/>
And fall a-cursing like a very drab,<br/>
A scullion! Fie upon&rsquo;t! Foh!<br/>
About, my brain! I have heard<br/>
That guilty creatures sitting at a play,<br/>
Have by the very cunning of the scene,<br/>
Been struck so to the soul that presently<br/>
They have proclaim&rsquo;d their malefactions.<br/>
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak<br/>
With most miraculous organ. I&rsquo;ll have these players<br/>
Play something like the murder of my father<br/>
Before mine uncle. I&rsquo;ll observe his looks;<br/>
I&rsquo;ll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,<br/>
I know my course. The spirit that I have seen<br/>
May be the devil, and the devil hath power<br/>
T&rsquo;assume a pleasing shape, yea, and perhaps<br/>
Out of my weakness and my melancholy,<br/>
As he is very potent with such spirits,<br/>
Abuses me to damn me. I&rsquo;ll have grounds<br/>
More relative than this. The play&rsquo;s the thing<br/>
Wherein I&rsquo;ll catch the conscience of the King.<br/>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
To be, or not to be, that is the question:<br/>
Whether &rsquo;tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br/>
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br/>
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,<br/>
And by opposing end them? To die&mdash;to sleep,<br/>
No more; and by a sleep to say we end<br/>
The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks<br/>
That flesh is heir to: &rsquo;tis a consummation<br/>
Devoutly to be wish&rsquo;d. To die, to sleep.<br/>
To sleep, perchance to dream&mdash;ay, there&rsquo;s the rub,<br/>
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,<br/>
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br/>
Must give us pause. There&rsquo;s the respect<br/>
That makes calamity of so long life.<br/>
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br/>
The oppressor&rsquo;s wrong, the proud man&rsquo;s contumely,<br/>
The pangs of dispriz&rsquo;d love, the law&rsquo;s delay,<br/>
The insolence of office, and the spurns<br/>
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,<br/>
When he himself might his quietus make<br/>
With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,<br/>
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br/>
But that the dread of something after death,<br/>
The undiscover&rsquo;d country, from whose bourn<br/>
No traveller returns, puzzles the will,<br/>
And makes us rather bear those ills we have<br/>
Than fly to others that we know not of?<br/>
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,<br/>
And thus the native hue of resolution<br/>
Is sicklied o&rsquo;er with the pale cast of thought,<br/>
And enterprises of great pith and moment,<br/>
With this regard their currents turn awry<br/>
And lose the name of action. Soft you now,<br/>
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons<br/>

My honour&rsquo;d lord, you know right well you did,<br/>
And with them words of so sweet breath compos&rsquo;d<br/>
As made the things more rich; their perfume lost,<br/>
Take these again; for to the noble mind<br/>
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.<br/>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
discourse to your beauty.</p>

<p>OPHELIA.<br/>
Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from
what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty
into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives
it proof. I did love you once.</p>

more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to
give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do
crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves all, believe none of

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
If thou dost marry, I&rsquo;ll give thee this plague for thy dowry.
Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go: farewell. Or if thou wilt
needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
Farewell.</p>

Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the
tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of your players do, I had as lief the
town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand,
thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may
say, whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may
give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the
ears of the groundlings, who, for the most part, are capable of nothing but

<p>FIRST PLAYER.<br/>
I warrant your honour.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your
tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action, with
this special observance, that you o&rsquo;erstep not the modesty of
nature; for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,
whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold as
&rsquo;twere the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his
form and pressure. Now, this overdone, or come tardy off, though
it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
o&rsquo;erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I
have seen play&mdash;and heard others praise, and that highly&mdash;not
to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of
Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature&rsquo;s
journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated
humanity so abominably.</p>

<p>FIRST PLAYER.<br/>
I hope we have reform&rsquo;d that indifferently with us, sir.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
O reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns
speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them
that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
spectators to laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary
question of the play be then to be considered. That&rsquo;s villanous,
and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go
make you ready.</p>

To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter&rsquo;d?<br/>
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,<br/>
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee<br/>
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?<br/>
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice,<br/>

Hath seal&rsquo;d thee for herself. For thou hast been<br/>
As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,<br/>

Hast ta&rsquo;en with equal thanks. And bles&rsquo;d are those<br/>

<p>PLAYER KING.<br/>
Full thirty times hath Phoebus&rsquo; cart gone round<br/>
Neptune&rsquo;s salt wash and Tellus&rsquo; orbed ground,<br/>
And thirty dozen moons with borrow&rsquo;d sheen<br/>
About the world have times twelve thirties been,<br/>
Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands<br/>
Unite commutual in most sacred bands.<br/>
</p>

<p>PLAYER QUEEN.<br/>
So many journeys may the sun and moon<br/>
Make us again count o&rsquo;er ere love be done.<br/>
But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,<br/>
So far from cheer and from your former state,<br/>
That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,<br/>
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:<br/>
For women&rsquo;s fear and love holds quantity,<br/>
In neither aught, or in extremity.<br/>
Now what my love is, proof hath made you know,<br/>
And as my love is siz&rsquo;d, my fear is so.<br/>
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;<br/>
Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.<br/>
</p>

<p>PLAYER KING.<br/>
Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too:<br/>
My operant powers their functions leave to do:<br/>
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,<br/>
Honour&rsquo;d, belov&rsquo;d, and haply one as kind<br/>
For husband shalt thou&mdash;<br/>
</p>

<p>PLAYER QUEEN.<br/>
O confound the rest.<br/>
Such love must needs be treason in my breast.<br/>
In second husband let me be accurst!<br/>
None wed the second but who kill&rsquo;d the first.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
[<i>Aside.</i>] Wormwood, wormwood.<br/>
</p>

<p>PLAYER QUEEN.<br/>
The instances that second marriage move<br/>
Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.<br/>
A second time I kill my husband dead,<br/>
When second husband kisses me in bed.<br/>
</p>

<p>PLAYER KING.<br/>
I do believe you think what now you speak;<br/>
But what we do determine, oft we break.<br/>
Purpose is but the slave to memory,<br/>
Of violent birth, but poor validity:<br/>
Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,<br/>
But fall unshaken when they mellow be.<br/>
Most necessary &rsquo;tis that we forget<br/>
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.<br/>
What to ourselves in passion we propose,<br/>
The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.<br/>
The violence of either grief or joy<br/>
Their own enactures with themselves destroy.<br/>
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;<br/>
Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.<br/>
This world is not for aye; nor &rsquo;tis not strange<br/>
That even our loves should with our fortunes change,<br/>
For &rsquo;tis a question left us yet to prove,<br/>
Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.<br/>
The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,<br/>
The poor advanc&rsquo;d makes friends of enemies;<br/>
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend:<br/>
For who not needs shall never lack a friend,<br/>
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,<br/>
Directly seasons him his enemy.<br/>
But orderly to end where I begun,<br/>
Our wills and fates do so contrary run<br/>
That our devices still are overthrown.<br/>
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.<br/>
So think thou wilt no second husband wed,<br/>
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.<br/>
</p>

<p>PLAYER QUEEN.<br/>
Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,<br/>
Sport and repose lock from me day and night,<br/>

Each opposite that blanks the face of joy,<br/>

Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,<br/>

<p>O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;<br/>
It hath the primal eldest curse upon&rsquo;t,&mdash;<br/>
A brother&rsquo;s murder! Pray can I not,<br/>
Though inclination be as sharp as will:<br/>
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,<br/>
And, like a man to double business bound,<br/>
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,<br/>
And both neglect. What if this cursed hand<br/>
Were thicker than itself with brother&rsquo;s blood,<br/>
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens<br/>
To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy<br/>
But to confront the visage of offence?<br/>
And what&rsquo;s in prayer but this twofold force,<br/>
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,<br/>
Or pardon&rsquo;d being down? Then I&rsquo;ll look up.<br/>
My fault is past. But O, what form of prayer<br/>
Can serve my turn? Forgive me my foul murder!<br/>
That cannot be; since I am still possess&rsquo;d<br/>
Of those effects for which I did the murder,&mdash;<br/>
My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.<br/>
May one be pardon&rsquo;d and retain th&rsquo;offence?<br/>
In the corrupted currents of this world<br/>
Offence&rsquo;s gilded hand may shove by justice,<br/>
And oft &rsquo;tis seen the wicked prize itself<br/>
Buys out the law. But &rsquo;tis not so above;<br/>
There is no shuffling, there the action lies<br/>
In his true nature, and we ourselves compell&rsquo;d<br/>
Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,<br/>
To give in evidence. What then? What rests?<br/>
Try what repentance can. What can it not?<br/>
Yet what can it, when one cannot repent?<br/>
O wretched state! O bosom black as death!<br/>
O limed soul, that struggling to be free,<br/>
Art more engag&rsquo;d! Help, angels! Make assay:<br/>
Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,<br/>

Such an act<br/>
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,<br/>
Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose<br/>
From the fair forehead of an innocent love,<br/>
And sets a blister there. Makes marriage vows<br/>
As false as dicers&rsquo; oaths. O such a deed<br/>
As from the body of contraction plucks<br/>
The very soul, and sweet religion makes<br/>
A rhapsody of words. Heaven&rsquo;s face doth glow,<br/>
Yea this solidity and compound mass,<br/>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Look here upon this picture, and on this,<br/>
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.<br/>
See what a grace was seated on this brow,<br/>
Hyperion&rsquo;s curls, the front of Jove himself,<br/>
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command,<br/>
A station like the herald Mercury<br/>
New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:<br/>
A combination and a form indeed,<br/>
Where every god did seem to set his seal,<br/>
To give the world assurance of a man.<br/>
This was your husband. Look you now what follows.<br/>
Here is your husband, like a mildew&rsquo;d ear<br/>
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?<br/>
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,<br/>
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?<br/>
You cannot call it love; for at your age<br/>
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it&rsquo;s humble,<br/>
And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment<br/>
Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,<br/>
Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense<br/>
Is apoplex&rsquo;d, for madness would not err<br/>
Nor sense to ecstacy was ne&rsquo;er so thrall&rsquo;d<br/>
But it reserv&rsquo;d some quantity of choice<br/>
To serve in such a difference. What devil was&rsquo;t<br/>
That thus hath cozen&rsquo;d you at hoodman-blind?<br/>
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,<br/>
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,<br/>
Or but a sickly part of one true sense<br/>
Could not so mope. O shame! where is thy blush?<br/>
Rebellious hell,<br/>
If thou canst mutine in a matron&rsquo;s bones,<br/>
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,<br/>
And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame<br/>
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,<br/>
Since frost itself as actively doth burn,<br/>
And reason panders will.<br/>

And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?<br/>
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep,<br/>
And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,<br/>
Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,<br/>
Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,<br/>
Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper<br/>
Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?<br/>

On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares,<br/>
His form and cause conjoin&rsquo;d, preaching to stones,<br/>
Would make them capable.&mdash;Do not look upon me,<br/>
Lest with this piteous action you convert<br/>
My stern effects. Then what I have to do<br/>
Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.<br/>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Ecstasy!<br/>
My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time,<br/>
And makes as healthful music. It is not madness<br/>
That I have utter&rsquo;d. Bring me to the test,<br/>
And I the matter will re-word; which madness<br/>
Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,<br/>
Lay not that flattering unction to your soul<br/>
That not your trespass, but my madness speaks.<br/>
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,<br/>
Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,<br/>
Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven,<br/>
Repent what&rsquo;s past, avoid what is to come;<br/>
And do not spread the compost on the weeds,<br/>
To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;<br/>
For in the fatness of these pursy times<br/>

Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.<br/>

O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.<br/>

Good night. But go not to mine uncle&rsquo;s bed.<br/>
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.<br/>
That monster custom, who all sense doth eat,<br/>
Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,<br/>
That to the use of actions fair and good<br/>
He likewise gives a frock or livery<br/>
That aptly is put on. Refrain tonight,<br/>
And that shall lend a kind of easiness<br/>
To the next abstinence. The next more easy;<br/>
For use almost can change the stamp of nature,<br/>
And either curb the devil, or throw him out<br/>
With wondrous potency. Once more, good night,<br/>
And when you are desirous to be bles&rsquo;d,<br/>
I&rsquo;ll blessing beg of you. For this same lord<br/>
[<i>Pointing to Polonius.</i>]<br/>
I do repent; but heaven hath pleas&rsquo;d it so,<br/>
To punish me with this, and this with me,<br/>
That I must be their scourge and minister.<br/>
I will bestow him, and will answer well<br/>
The death I gave him. So again, good night.<br/>

Pinch wanton on your cheek, call you his mouse,<br/>
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,<br/>
Or paddling in your neck with his damn&rsquo;d fingers,<br/>
Make you to ravel all this matter out,<br/>
That I essentially am not in madness,<br/>
But mad in craft. &rsquo;Twere good you let him know,<br/>
For who that&rsquo;s but a queen, fair, sober, wise,<br/>
Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,<br/>
Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?<br/>
No, in despite of sense and secrecy,<br/>
Unpeg the basket on the house&rsquo;s top,<br/>
Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,<br/>
To try conclusions, in the basket creep<br/>
And break your own neck down.<br/>
</p>

Be thou assur&rsquo;d, if words be made of breath,<br/>
And breath of life, I have no life to breathe<br/>

Whom I will trust as I will adders fang&rsquo;d,&mdash;<br/>

And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;<br/>
For &rsquo;tis the sport to have the enginer<br/>
Hoist with his own petard, and &rsquo;t shall go hard<br/>
But I will delve one yard below their mines<br/>
And blow them at the moon. O, &rsquo;tis most sweet,<br/>
When in one line two crafts directly meet.<br/>
This man shall set me packing.<br/>
I&rsquo;ll lug the guts into the neighbour room.<br/>
Mother, good night. Indeed, this counsellor<br/>

Who was in life a foolish peating knave.<br/>
Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.<br/>

Ay, sir; that soaks up the King&rsquo;s countenance, his rewards,
his authorities. But such officers do the King best service in
the end: he keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw;
first mouthed, to be last swallowed: when he needs what you have

boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship, so I
alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves

Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,&mdash;<br/>
My virtue or my plague, be it either which,&mdash;<br/>
She&rsquo;s so conjunctive to my life and soul,<br/>
That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,<br/>
I could not but by her. The other motive,<br/>
Why to a public count I might not go,<br/>
Is the great love the general gender bear him,<br/>
Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,<br/>
Would like the spring that turneth wood to stone,<br/>

Can you advise me?<br/>

As checking at his voyage, and that he means<br/>
No more to undertake it, I will work him<br/>
To exploit, now ripe in my device,<br/>
Under the which he shall not choose but fall;<br/>
And for his death no wind shall breathe,<br/>
But even his mother shall uncharge the practice<br/>
And call it accident.<br/>

My lord, I will be rul&rsquo;d;<br/>
The rather if you could devise it so<br/>
That I might be the organ.<br/>

<p>KING.<br/>
It falls right.<br/>
You have been talk&rsquo;d of since your travel much,<br/>
And that in Hamlet&rsquo;s hearing, for a quality<br/>
Wherein they say you shine. Your sum of parts<br/>
Did not together pluck such envy from him<br/>
As did that one, and that, in my regard,<br/>
Of the unworthiest siege.<br/>
</p>

<p>LAERTES.<br/>
What part is that, my lord?<br/>
</p>

<p>KING.<br/>
A very riband in the cap of youth,<br/>
Yet needful too, for youth no less becomes<br/>
The light and careless livery that it wears<br/>
Than settled age his sables and his weeds,<br/>
Importing health and graveness. Two months since<br/>
Here was a gentleman of Normandy,&mdash;<br/>
I&rsquo;ve seen myself, and serv&rsquo;d against, the French,<br/>
And they can well on horseback, but this gallant<br/>
Had witchcraft in&rsquo;t. He grew unto his seat,<br/>
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,<br/>
As had he been incorps&rsquo;d and demi-natur&rsquo;d<br/>
With the brave beast. So far he topp&rsquo;d my thought<br/>
That I in forgery of shapes and tricks,<br/>
Come short of what he did.<br/>
</p>

<p>LAERTES.<br/>

Upon my life, Lamond.<br/>

<p>KING.<br/>
The very same.<br/>
</p>

<p>LAERTES.<br/>
I know him well. He is the brooch indeed<br/>
And gem of all the nation.<br/>
</p>

<p>KING.<br/>
He made confession of you,<br/>
And gave you such a masterly report<br/>
For art and exercise in your defence,<br/>
And for your rapier most especially,<br/>
That he cried out &rsquo;twould be a sight indeed<br/>
If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation<br/>
He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,<br/>
If you oppos&rsquo;d them. Sir, this report of his<br/>
Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy<br/>
That he could nothing do but wish and beg<br/>
Your sudden coming o&rsquo;er to play with him.<br/>
Now, out of this,&mdash;<br/>
</p>

<p>LAERTES.<br/>
What out of this, my lord?<br/>
</p>

<p>KING.<br/>
Laertes, was your father dear to you?<br/>
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,<br/>
A face without a heart?<br/>
</p>

<p>LAERTES.<br/>
Why ask you this?<br/>
</p>

<p>KING.<br/>
Not that I think you did not love your father,<br/>
But that I know love is begun by time,<br/>
And that I see, in passages of proof,<br/>
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.<br/>
There lives within the very flame of love<br/>
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;<br/>
And nothing is at a like goodness still,<br/>
For goodness, growing to a pleurisy,<br/>
Dies in his own too much. That we would do,<br/>
We should do when we would; for this &lsquo;would&rsquo; changes,<br/>
And hath abatements and delays as many<br/>
As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;<br/>
And then this &lsquo;should&rsquo; is like a spendthrift sigh<br/>
That hurts by easing. But to the quick o&rsquo; th&rsquo;ulcer:<br/>
Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake<br/>
To show yourself your father&rsquo;s son in deed,<br/>
More than in words?<br/>
</p>

<p>LAERTES.<br/>
To cut his throat i&rsquo; th&rsquo; church.<br/>
</p>

<p>KING.<br/>
No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;<br/>
Revenge should have no bounds. But good Laertes,<br/>
Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.<br/>
Hamlet return&rsquo;d shall know you are come home:<br/>
We&rsquo;ll put on those shall praise your excellence,<br/>
And set a double varnish on the fame<br/>
The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together<br/>
And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,<br/>
Most generous, and free from all contriving,<br/>
Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,<br/>
Or with a little shuffling, you may choose<br/>
A sword unbated, and in a pass of practice,<br/>
Requite him for your father.<br/>
</p>

<p>LAERTES.<br/>
I will do&rsquo;t.<br/>
And for that purpose I&rsquo;ll anoint my sword.<br/>
I bought an unction of a mountebank<br/>
So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,<br/>
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,<br/>
Collected from all simples that have virtue<br/>
Under the moon, can save the thing from death<br/>
This is but scratch&rsquo;d withal. I&rsquo;ll touch my point<br/>
With this contagion, that if I gall him slightly,<br/>
It may be death.<br/>
</p>

<p>KING.<br/>
Let&rsquo;s further think of this,<br/>
Weigh what convenience both of time and means<br/>
May fit us to our shape. If this should fail,<br/>
And that our drift look through our bad performance.<br/>
&rsquo;Twere better not assay&rsquo;d. Therefore this project<br/>
Should have a back or second, that might hold<br/>
If this did blast in proof. Soft, let me see.<br/>
We&rsquo;ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings,&mdash;<br/>
I ha&rsquo;t! When in your motion you are hot and dry,<br/>
As make your bouts more violent to that end,<br/>
And that he calls for drink, I&rsquo;ll have prepar&rsquo;d him<br/>
A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,<br/>

There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds<br/>
Clamb&rsquo;ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,<br/>
When down her weedy trophies and herself<br/>
Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,<br/>
And mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up,<br/>

I tell thee she is, and therefore make her grave straight. The

How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?</p>

<p>SECOND CLOWN.<br/>
Why, &rsquo;tis found so.</p>

<p>FIRST CLOWN.<br/>
It must be <i>se offendendo</i>, it cannot be else. For here lies
the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an
act hath three branches. It is to act, to do, and to perform:
argal, she drowned herself wittingly.</p>

<p>SECOND CLOWN.<br/>
Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,&mdash;</p>

<p>FIRST CLOWN.<br/>
Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands the
man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it is,
will he nill he, he goes,&mdash;mark you that. But if the water come
to him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is
not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.</p>

Why, there thou say&rsquo;st. And the more pity that great folk
should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves
more than their even Christian. Come, my spade. There is no

<p>FIRST CLOWN.<br/>
I like thy wit well in good faith, the gallows does well.
But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
church; argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To&rsquo;t again, come.</p>

</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Throws up another skull.</i>]</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
There&rsquo;s another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,
and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock
him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him
of his action of battery? Hum. This fellow might be in&rsquo;s time a
great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his
fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine of
his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more of
his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth
of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will
scarcely lie in this box; and must the inheritor himself have no
more, ha?</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
Not a jot more, my lord.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Is not parchment made of sheep-skins?<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I
will speak to this fellow.&mdash;Whose grave&rsquo;s this, sir?</p>

<p>FIRST CLOWN.<br/>
Mine, sir.<br/>
[<i>Sings.</i>]<br/>
¬†¬†¬†O, a pit of clay for to be made<br/>
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†For such a guest is meet.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in&rsquo;t.<br/>
</p>

<p>FIRST CLOWN.<br/>
You lie out on&rsquo;t, sir, and therefore &rsquo;tis not yours.<br/>
For my part, I do not lie in&rsquo;t, yet it is mine.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Thou dost lie in&rsquo;t, to be in&rsquo;t and say it is thine. &rsquo;Tis for
the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.</p>

<p>FIRST CLOWN.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis a quick lie, sir; &rsquo;t will away again from me to you.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
What man dost thou dig it for?<br/>
</p>

<p>FIRST CLOWN.<br/>
For no man, sir.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
What woman then?<br/>
</p>

<p>FIRST CLOWN.<br/>
For none neither.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Who is to be buried in&rsquo;t?<br/>
</p>

<p>FIRST CLOWN.<br/>
One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she&rsquo;s dead.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, these three
years I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that
the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
galls his kibe.&mdash;How long hast thou been a grave-maker?</p>

<p>FIRST CLOWN.<br/>
Of all the days i&rsquo; th&rsquo; year, I came to&rsquo;t that day that our
last King Hamlet o&rsquo;ercame Fortinbras.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
How long is that since?<br/>
</p>

<p>FIRST CLOWN.<br/>
Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was the
very day that young Hamlet was born,&mdash;he that is mad, and sent
into England.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?<br/>
</p>

<p>FIRST CLOWN.<br/>
Why, because he was mad; he shall recover his wits there;
or if he do not, it&rsquo;s no great matter there.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Why?<br/>
</p>

<p>FIRST CLOWN.<br/>
&rsquo;Twill not be seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
How came he mad?<br/>
</p>

<p>FIRST CLOWN.<br/>
Very strangely, they say.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
How strangely?<br/>
</p>

<p>FIRST CLOWN.<br/>
Faith, e&rsquo;en with losing his wits.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Upon what ground?<br/>
</p>

<p>FIRST CLOWN.<br/>
Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy,
thirty years.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
How long will a man lie i&rsquo; th&rsquo;earth ere he rot?<br/>
</p>

<p>FIRST CLOWN.<br/>
Faith, if he be not rotten before he die,&mdash;as we have many
pocky corses nowadays that will scarce hold the laying in,&mdash;he
will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will last
you nine year.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Why he more than another?<br/>
</p>

<p>FIRST CLOWN.<br/>
Why, sir, his hide is so tann&rsquo;d with his trade that he will
keep out water a great while. And your water is a sore decayer of
your whoreson dead body. Here&rsquo;s a skull now; this skull hath lain
in the earth three-and-twenty years.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Whose was it?<br/>
</p>

<p>FIRST CLOWN.<br/>
A whoreson, mad fellow&rsquo;s it was. Whose do you think it was?</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Nay, I know not.<br/>
</p>

<p>FIRST CLOWN.<br/>
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! A pour&rsquo;d a flagon of Rhenish on my
head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick&rsquo;s skull, the King&rsquo;s
jester.
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
This?<br/>
</p>

<p>FIRST CLOWN.<br/>
E&rsquo;en that.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Let me see. [<i>Takes the skull.</i>] Alas, poor Yorick. I knew him,
Horatio, a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He
hath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred
in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those
lips that I have kiss&rsquo;d I know not how oft. Where be your gibes
now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that
were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your
own grinning? Quite chop-fallen? Now get you to my lady&rsquo;s
chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
favour she must come. Make her laugh at that.&mdash;Prythee, Horatio,
tell me one thing.</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
What&rsquo;s that, my lord?<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Dost thou think Alexander looked o&rsquo; this fashion i&rsquo; th&rsquo;earth?<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
E&rsquo;en so.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
And smelt so? Pah!<br/>
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Throws down the skull.</i>]</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
E&rsquo;en so, my lord.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
stopping a bung-hole?</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
&rsquo;Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
No, faith, not a jot. But to follow him thither with modesty
enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus. Alexander died,
Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is
earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam whereto he
was converted might they not stop a beer-barrel?<br/>
Imperious Caesar, dead and turn&rsquo;d to clay,<br/>
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.<br/>
O, that that earth which kept the world in awe<br/>
Should patch a wall t&rsquo;expel the winter&rsquo;s flaw.<br/>

Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home<br/>
Of bell and burial.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Up from my cabin,<br/>
My sea-gown scarf&rsquo;d about me, in the dark<br/>
Grop&rsquo;d I to find out them; had my desire,<br/>
Finger&rsquo;d their packet, and in fine, withdrew<br/>
To mine own room again, making so bold,<br/>
My fears forgetting manners, to unseal<br/>
Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,<br/>
Oh royal knavery! an exact command,<br/>
Larded with many several sorts of reasons,<br/>
Importing Denmark&rsquo;s health, and England&rsquo;s too,<br/>
With ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,<br/>

Being thus benetted round with villanies,&mdash;<br/>
Or I could make a prologue to my brains,<br/>
They had begun the play,&mdash;I sat me down,<br/>
Devis&rsquo;d a new commission, wrote it fair:<br/>
I once did hold it, as our statists do,<br/>
A baseness to write fair, and labour&rsquo;d much<br/>
How to forget that learning; but, sir, now<br/>
It did me yeoman&rsquo;s service. Wilt thou know<br/>
The effect of what I wrote?<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
Ay, good my lord.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
An earnest conjuration from the King,<br/>
As England was his faithful tributary,<br/>
As love between them like the palm might flourish,<br/>
As peace should still her wheaten garland wear<br/>
And stand a comma &rsquo;tween their amities,<br/>
And many such-like &lsquo;as&rsquo;es of great charge,<br/>

I had my father&rsquo;s signet in my purse,<br/>
Which was the model of that Danish seal:<br/>
Folded the writ up in the form of the other,<br/>
Subscrib&rsquo;d it: gave&rsquo;t th&rsquo;impression; plac&rsquo;d it safely,<br/>
The changeling never known. Now, the next day<br/>
Was our sea-fight, and what to this was sequent<br/>

So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to&rsquo;t.<br/>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Why, man, they did make love to this employment.<br/>
They are not near my conscience; their defeat<br/>

impart a thing to you from his Majesty.</p>

I will receive it with all diligence of spirit. Put your

he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the
matter,&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p class="right"> [<i><span class="charname">Hamlet</span> moves him to put on

<p>OSRIC.<br/>
Nay, in good faith; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here
is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute
gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft
society and great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he
is the card or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the
continent of what part a gentleman would see.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I
know, to divide him inventorially would dizzy th&rsquo;arithmetic of
memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail.
But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great
article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make
true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror and who else
would trace him his umbrage, nothing more.</p>

<p>OSRIC.<br/>
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.<br/>
</p>

rawer breath?</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>

</p>

<p>OSRIC.<br/>
I know you are not ignorant,&mdash;<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
I would you did, sir; yet in faith if you did, it would not
much approve me. Well, sir?</p>

<p>OSRIC.<br/>
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is,&mdash;<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.</p>

<p>OSRIC.<br/>
I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on
him, by them in his meed he&rsquo;s unfellowed.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
What&rsquo;s his weapon?<br/>
</p>

<p>OSRIC.<br/>
Rapier and dagger.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
That&rsquo;s two of his weapons. But well.<br/>
</p>

<p>OSRIC.<br/>
The King, sir, hath wager&rsquo;d with him six Barbary horses,
against the which he has imponed, as I take it, six French
rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and
so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
very liberal conceit.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
What call you the carriages?<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
I knew you must be edified by the margin ere you had done.<br/>
</p>

<p>OSRIC.<br/>
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
The phrase would be more german to the matter if we could
carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then.
But on. Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
assigns, and three liberal conceited carriages: that&rsquo;s the French
bet against the Danish. Why is this all imponed, as you call it?</p>

<p>OSRIC.<br/>
The King, sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes between
you and him, he shall not exceed you three hits. He hath
laid on twelve for nine. And it would come to immediate trial
if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
How if I answer no?<br/>
</p>

<p>OSRIC.<br/>
I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty,
it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his purpose,
I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my
shame and the odd hits.</p>

<p>OSRIC.<br/>
Shall I re-deliver you e&rsquo;en so?<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.<br/>
</p>

<p>OSRIC.<br/>
I commend my duty to your lordship.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Yours, yours.<br/>
</p>

<p>He does well to commend it himself, there are no tongues else
for&rsquo;s turn.</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
He did comply with his dug before he suck&rsquo;d it. Thus has he,&mdash;and
many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on,&mdash;
only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter;
a kind of yeasty collection, which carries them through and
through the most fanned and winnowed opinions; and do but blow
them to their trial, the bubbles are out,</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter a <span class="charname">Lord</span>.</p>

<p>LORD.<br/>
My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric,
who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall. He sends
to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes or that you
will take longer time.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
I am constant to my purposes, they follow the King&rsquo;s pleasure. If his
fitness speaks, mine is ready. Now or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.
</p>

<p>LORD.<br/>
The King and Queen and all are coming down.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
In happy time.<br/>
</p>

<p>LORD.<br/>
The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you
fall to play.
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
She well instructs me.<br/>
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exit <span class="charname">Lord</span>.</i>]</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
You will lose this wager, my lord.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
I do not think so. Since he went into France, I have been in continual
practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill
all&rsquo;s here about my heart: but it is no matter.
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
Nay, good my lord.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as
would perhaps trouble a woman.</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their
repair hither, and say you are not fit.</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Not a whit, we defy augury. There&rsquo;s a special providence in
the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, &rsquo;tis not to come; if it be
not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come.
The readiness is all. Since no man has aught of what he leaves,
what is&rsquo;t to leave betimes?</p>

Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;<br/>
But pardon&rsquo;t as you are a gentleman.<br/>
This presence knows, and you must needs have heard,<br/>
How I am punish&rsquo;d with sore distraction.<br/>
What I have done<br/>
That might your nature, honour, and exception<br/>
Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.<br/>
Was&rsquo;t Hamlet wrong&rsquo;d Laertes? Never Hamlet.<br/>
If Hamlet from himself be ta&rsquo;en away,<br/>
And when he&rsquo;s not himself does wrong Laertes,<br/>
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.<br/>
Who does it, then? His madness. If&rsquo;t be so,<br/>
Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong&rsquo;d;<br/>
His madness is poor Hamlet&rsquo;s enemy.<br/>
Sir, in this audience,<br/>
Let my disclaiming from a purpos&rsquo;d evil<br/>
Free me so far in your most generous thoughts<br/>
That I have shot my arrow o&rsquo;er the house<br/>
And hurt my brother.<br/>
</p>

<p>LAERTES.<br/>
I am satisfied in nature,<br/>
Whose motive in this case should stir me most<br/>
To my revenge. But in my terms of honour<br/>
I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement<br/>
Till by some elder masters of known honour<br/>
I have a voice and precedent of peace<br/>
To keep my name ungor&rsquo;d. But till that time<br/>
I do receive your offer&rsquo;d love like love,<br/>
And will not wrong it.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
I embrace it freely,<br/>
And will this brother&rsquo;s wager frankly play.&mdash;<br/>
Give us the foils; come on.<br/>
</p>

<p>LAERTES.<br/>
Come, one for me.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
I&rsquo;ll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance<br/>
Your skill shall like a star i&rsquo; th&rsquo; darkest night,<br/>
Stick fiery off indeed.<br/>
</p>

<p>LAERTES.<br/>
You mock me, sir.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
No, by this hand.<br/>
</p>

<p>KING.<br/>
Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,<br/>
You know the wager?<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Very well, my lord.<br/>
Your Grace has laid the odds o&rsquo; the weaker side.<br/>
</p>

<p>KING.<br/>
I do not fear it. I have seen you both;<br/>
But since he is better&rsquo;d, we have therefore odds.<br/>
</p>

<p>LAERTES.<br/>
This is too heavy. Let me see another.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
This likes me well. These foils have all a length?<br/>
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>They prepare to play.</i>]</p>

<p>OSRIC.<br/>
Ay, my good lord.<br/>
</p>

<p>KING.<br/>
Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.<br/>
If Hamlet give the first or second hit,<br/>
Or quit in answer of the third exchange,<br/>
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;<br/>
The King shall drink to Hamlet&rsquo;s better breath,<br/>
And in the cup an union shall he throw<br/>
Richer than that which four successive kings<br/>
In Denmark&rsquo;s crown have worn. Give me the cups;<br/>
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,<br/>
The trumpet to the cannoneer without,<br/>
The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,<br/>
&lsquo;Now the King drinks to Hamlet.&rsquo; Come, begin.<br/>
And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.<br/>
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>They play.</i>]</p>

Good madam.<br/>

How is&rsquo;t, Laertes?<br/>

Why, as a woodcock to my own springe, Osric.<br/>

</p>

Unbated and envenom&rsquo;d. The foul practice<br/>
Hath turn&rsquo;d itself on me. Lo, here I lie,<br/>
Never to rise again. Thy mother&rsquo;s poison&rsquo;d.<br/>
I can no more. The King, the King&rsquo;s to blame.<br/>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.<br/>
I am dead, Horatio. Wretched Queen, adieu.<br/>

That are but mutes or audience to this act,<br/>

Is strict in his arrest,&mdash;O, I could tell you,&mdash;<br/>
But let it be. Horatio, I am dead,<br/>
Thou liv&rsquo;st; report me and my cause aright<br/>
To the unsatisfied.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
Never believe it.<br/>
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.<br/>
Here&rsquo;s yet some liquor left.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
As th&rsquo;art a man,<br/>
Give me the cup. Let go; by Heaven, I&rsquo;ll have&rsquo;t.<br/>
O good Horatio, what a wounded name,<br/>
Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me.<br/>
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,<br/>
Absent thee from felicity awhile,<br/>
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,<br/>
To tell my story.<br/>
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>March afar off, and shot within.</i>]</p>

<p>What warlike noise is this?</p>

To the ambassadors of England gives<br/>
This warlike volley.<br/>
</p>

<p>HAMLET.<br/>
O, I die, Horatio.<br/>
The potent poison quite o&rsquo;er-crows my spirit:<br/>
I cannot live to hear the news from England,<br/>
But I do prophesy th&rsquo;election lights<br/>
On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.<br/>
So tell him, with the occurrents more and less,<br/>
Which have solicited. The rest is silence.<br/>
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Dies.</i>]</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,<br/>
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.<br/>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Fortinbras, the English
Ambassadors</span> and others.</p>

Where is this sight?<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
What is it you would see?<br/>
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.<br/>
</p>

<p>FORTINBRAS.<br/>
This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,<br/>
What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,<br/>
That thou so many princes at a shot<br/>
So bloodily hast struck?<br/>
</p>

<p>FIRST AMBASSADOR.<br/>
The sight is dismal;<br/>
And our affairs from England come too late.<br/>
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,<br/>
To tell him his commandment is fulfill&rsquo;d,<br/>
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.<br/>
Where should we have our thanks?<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
Not from his mouth,<br/>
Had it th&rsquo;ability of life to thank you.<br/>
He never gave commandment for their death.<br/>
But since, so jump upon this bloody question,<br/>
You from the Polack wars, and you from England<br/>
Are here arriv&rsquo;d, give order that these bodies<br/>
High on a stage be placed to the view,<br/>
And let me speak to th&rsquo; yet unknowing world<br/>
How these things came about. So shall you hear<br/>
Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts,<br/>
Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,<br/>
Of deaths put on by cunning and forc&rsquo;d cause,<br/>
And, in this upshot, purposes mistook<br/>
Fall&rsquo;n on the inventors&rsquo; heads. All this can I<br/>
Truly deliver.<br/>
</p>

<p>FORTINBRAS.<br/>
Let us haste to hear it,<br/>
And call the noblest to the audience.<br/>
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.<br/>
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,<br/>
Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.<br/>
</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br/>
Of that I shall have also cause to speak,<br/>
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.<br/>
But let this same be presently perform&rsquo;d,<br/>
Even while men&rsquo;s minds are wild, lest more mischance<br/>
On plots and errors happen.<br/>
</p>

<p>FORTINBRAS.<br/>
Let four captains<br/>
Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage,<br/>
For he was likely, had he been put on,<br/>
To have prov&rsquo;d most royally; and for his passage,<br/>
The soldiers&rsquo; music and the rites of war<br/>
Speak loudly for him.<br/>
Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this<br/>
Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.<br/>
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.<br/>
</p>

ordnance is shot off.</i>]</p>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
