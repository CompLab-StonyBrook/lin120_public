    "Sometimes, the code in a cell may require that you have already run a previous code cell.\n",

    "Below are two code cells.\n",
    "The second one requires that a piece of code in the first cell has already been run.\n",
    "For clarity, let's call the first cell the *dependent* and the second cell the *provider*.\n",
    "Before you go on any further, you should convince yourself that the dependent does indeed require the provider: skip the provider and immediately run the dependent, i.e. the second cell.\n",

    "Actually this error message isn't too bad, and as a beginning programmer you will see many error messages throughout the semester.\n",

    "The important thing is that you don't let errors discourage you and instead focus on how to deal with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case at hand, the problem is that we skipped the supplier (= the first cell), which is required by the dependent (= the second cell).\n",
    "Note how to left of the dependent cell it now says `In [1]`.\n",
    "This means that it was the first code cell to be run in this notebook.\n",
    "Now run the provider.\n",
    "You won't see any output, but you can tell that it has been run because the `In [ ]` next to it has changed to `In [2]`. The 2 indicates that we ran this cell right after whatever cell was `In [1]` (the dependent, in this case).\n",
    "\n",

    "Always make sure that you run the cells in a notebook in order.\n",
    "For many cells it will not matter because they are completely self-contained.\n",
    "But as our examples get bigger and more complex, it will be helpful to split code over multiple cells, and then you cannot run the fifth cell without having already run cells 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n",
    "Pay attention to the value of `x` for `In [x]`.\n",
