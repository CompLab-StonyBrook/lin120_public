    "# Even More Regex Tricks\n",
    "\n",
    "While wrestling with regular expressions, you might have at some point resorted to Google in order to find help on an aspect of regexes that you do not fully understand.\n",
    "Odds are that while doing so you came across the [documentation for Python's re module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html).\n",
    "If so, your head probably exploded halfway in - there really are a tons of special commands, functions, and parameters.\n",
    "But the thing is, most of the time you do not need any of those.\n",
    "That's the 90-10 rule: 90% of the time you only need 10% of the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous units were all about covering those 10% so that you can work productively with regular expressions.\n",
    "This expansion unit dips within the remaining 10%.\n",
    "But we still don't cover everything, that would take an entire book (like Friedl's [Mastering Regular Expressions](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596528126.do), which spans a whopping 544 pages).\n",
    "Instead, we'll once again apply the 90-10 rule: within those features that are only needed in 10% of all cases, which ones cover the majority of those rare cases?"
