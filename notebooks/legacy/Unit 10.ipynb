    "The regular expression accomplishes this as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `frac{`: matches frac{\n",
    "1. `(`: starts the first group\n",
    "1. `[^,]*`: 0 or more characters that are not a comma\n",
    "1.  `)`: ends the first group\n",
    "1.  `,`: matches the comma\n",
    "1.  `\\s*`: 0 or more whitespace characters (space, tabulator, newline)\n",
    "1.  `(`: starts the second group\n",
    "1.  `[^}]*`: 0 ore more characters that are not }\n",
    "1.  `)`: ends the second group\n",
    "1.  `}`: matches }\n",

    "As you can see, the regex may look like an intimidating barrage of strange characters at first, but if you carefully work through it from left to right you can make sense of it soon enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's another case where I use regular expressions a fair bit in my daily routine: inserting links.\n",
    "In markdown, any string can be made a link by surrounding it in square brackets and following it up by a URL in parenthesis.\n",
