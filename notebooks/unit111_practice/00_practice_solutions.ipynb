    "This exercise is almost entirely dependent on the way you chose to implement your classifier, but the important takeaway is that you can use `str.lower()` on the inputs to avoid having to write many `if` statements handling different capitalization on the inputs \"yes\" or \"y\". We can also further shorten it by checking if the input is in a list containing the possible answers \"yes\" and \"y\". This allows for all sorts of inputs ranging from `YeS` and `yES` to `Y` and `y`, which we know all mean the same thing."

    "\n",
    "**Error 1** is happening because the Counter collection requires us to access its data via key-value pairs. In other words, every element of a Counter is a character we can \"look-up\" (like a word in a dictionary) associated with a numerical value representing the count of that character. The `for`-loop is iterating through every `count` in `char_counter`, but just because we named the variable `count` doesn't mean we're actually accessing a number. In fact, what we are trying to do by saying this is iterate through the characters in `char_counter`, not their counts. So, knowing this, if we just say `if count > 5`, the code interprets this as trying to compare a string to an integer. There is no way to determine whether h > 5, for example, so the program will crash. \n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this issue, we need to actually address the numerical count associated with a given letter. The characters of `char_counter` act as keys, so in order to get their values we can say `char_counter[count]`. This will fix the problem of the program crashing. If it helps, try renaming `count` to something else, like `c`, since the variable itself is a bit misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for **Error 2**, the problem there is that the `if` statement is outside of the `for`- loop, so the message about having a lot of tokens for one character might never print even if you have characters with more than 5 tokens in the string. Why? Because the `for`-loop resets `message` at each iteration. Unless the last character it loops over in `char_counter` has > 5 tokens, `message` will not be `True` by the time an `if` statement outside of the loop checks it. By putting it inside the loop, this check is done at each iteration so the message will print any time a character has more than 5 tokens."

    "`all()` we need to do here (har har) is apply our first function, `is_well_formatted()`, to each token in the list of tokens given to the function, and then have `all()` evaluate the resulting list of truth values. We can do this in one line by doing it at the same time that we call `all()`. "
