    "This ability is also called *control flow*.\n",

    "\n",
    "## The basic format\n",
    "\n",
    "An `if` statement always takes the same form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if Boolean condition:\n",
    "    code to execute if condtion holds\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us decompose this into distinct components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  the code starts with `if`\n",
    "1.  on the same line there must be some piece of code that evaluates to a Boolean (`True` or `False`)\n",
    "1.  the line must end with `:`\n",
    "1.  the next line contains the code to be executed if the conditions evaluates to `True`;\n",
    "    this code can span multiple lines, but every line must be indented by a tabulator relative to the `if` statement"
