    "All the material covered here is also part of unit 11 or unit 12.\n",
    "The purpose of this unit is to provide an easier entrance point to custom functions.\n",
    "Unit 11 attempts to give a fairly realistic example of why custom functions are useful in the real world, including chatbots: custom functions greatly simplify the code.\n",
    "But in order to get this point across, unit 11 has to use a fairly complex program that is gradually simplified by using functions.\n",
    "This means that you have to spend a fair amount of your mental capacities on understanding the code before you can start to learn about functions.\n",
    "This unit instead presents a very simple program where functions already pay off."

    "1. after that we have opening and closing parenthesis, with zero or more arguments in between\n",
    "1. arguments can be used like defined variables inside the function code\n",
