    "Before you can start to learn about Python, you have to master the usage of Python notebooks.\n",
    "Don't worry, it's very easy and will be like second nature to you after a week or two.\n",

    "## What is a Python notebook, and why do we use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python notebook is very different from the environments professional programmers use to develop software.\n",
    "It is more like a scratch pad where code can be interwoven with normal text, images, links to videos, and so on.\n",
    "While a programmer would rarely need those things, they are very useful for a beginner who is still learning the ropes.\n",
    "For this course, you can think of the notebooks as chapters of a highly interactive textbook.\n",
    "Any code in this \"textbook\" can be run to see what it does.\n",
    "And you can add your own code to run it.\n",
    "That's the really cool thing about Python notebooks.\n",
    "It's as if you could scribble your code directly on the pages of a textbook and run it right there.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How will notebooks be used in this course?\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks are both your **primary Python reference** and **your Python homeworks**.\n",
    "Each notebook contains a number of exercises.\n",
    "For each exercise, you write down your answer right below it in the notebook and then save the notebook.\n",
    "That's it.\n",
    "There's no handwritten assignments, no files you have to submit on Blackboard, zilch, zero, nada.\n",
    "You just write your answers directly into the notebook, save it, and we'll automatically collect them through Cocalc once the deadline has passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, Cocalc automatically saves your notebooks.\n",
    "We still recommend that you manually save before closing the notebook, just to be sure nothing is lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How exactly does this work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a very simple example, which also happpens to be your first exercise."
