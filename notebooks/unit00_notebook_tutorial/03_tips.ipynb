    "## Hotkey for executing cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Later notebooks will have many code cells for you to run.\n",
    "After a while, it will get very annoying to always select the cell, then move all the way to the top toolbar to run the code.\n",
    "Instead, you can hit `SHIFT` and `ENTER` at the same time on your keyboard.\n",
    "This executes the currently selected cell and automatically selects the next one.\n",
    "That way, you can hit `SHIFT` and `ENTER` multiple times to quickly execute multiple cells.\n",

    "## Undoing changes\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're editing a cell and accidentally delete something, you can undo the change by pressing `CTRL` and `z` at the same time.\n",
    "Each cell has its own undo history, but this history is lost if you close the notebook.\n",
    "So if you make some changes, save the notebook, close it, and then realize later on that you don't like some of the changes, you're out of luck.\n",
    "Cocalc has an additional backup system called *TimeTravel*, but it is best left untouched unless you know what you're doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Every notebook is essentially a collection of Python code cells like the one in the very first exercise you did, and text cells like the one in the second exercise.\n",
    "Each one you can edit to your liking.\n",
    "So you can add your own notes to any cell as you see fit.\n",
    "As long as the notebook still contains all the exercises and your answers to it, it is ready for grading."
